this document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological illness in which patients have alternating episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ia ) alternating with periods of normal sen@@ timent . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used to control increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to dispos@@ ing or the melting tablets can be applied in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are also broken down as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , &quot; i.e. , chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is believed to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the brain &apos;s activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar illnesses , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients addressing the treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms than placebo . &quot;
&quot; moreover , up to 74 weeks ago , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; even more effective than placebo , Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled shr@@ ink@@ age ) , headaches , blur@@ red vision , vom@@ iting , nausea , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mostly man@@ ic episodes , out@@ weighing the man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd a permit for the launch of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes , and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after menop@@ ause , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transition disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ign form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is necessary if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ an ) . &quot;
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study for over 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were reduced ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ dest@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and have been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause of death . &quot;
&quot; although no information on the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is present in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma bonding . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity with the dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; administered by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients , who attended a response to study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction of the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) occurred with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy that was superior to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the mean eli@@ oration time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , with extensive metabol@@ isation over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a study @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) and combined adren@@ al rin@@ ds ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated or@@ ally dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile duct , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late @-@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; 34 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;

&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals daily .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects resp@@ . an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy that was superior to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were after dos@@ ages , which were too ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical trial . &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; 71 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) occurred with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as a solution for intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 In addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the one @-@ to @-@ three of the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of as@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is deemed necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transition disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ign form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects resp@@ . an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ gregation was greater compared with the one @-@ time administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study conducted in healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ time indication , and the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ gregation was greater compared to that after all the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and have been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms as compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed mean improvement of the initial value at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ dep@@ age , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients , who attended a response to study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction of the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % occurred compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % higher in the first 2 hours after injection of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time up to the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application showed no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) and combined adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a drug containing conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drug drugs such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were indic@@ ative of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer considered to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel , drugs were not given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy in the following series the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment will be interrupted until a improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient group are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ ques and preserv@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child to testify . &quot;
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm retention due to the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible im@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can impact on traffic and ability to operate machinery . &quot;
the following are the most common and most important incidents reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects listed in conjunction with the addition of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication have occurred in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ eness in the abdom@@ en , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness , very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency were possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ ec@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the composition of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules out of the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation results in in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
&quot; it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells , and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that this improved trans@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and , due to the alb@@ um@@ inal protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , occurs in the tumor area . &quot;
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two @-@ one @-@ approved non @-@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of the patients had an impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metasta@@ sis and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
the results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml as compared to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After an intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel after an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of abrasion were compared with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
the Clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
&quot; the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box , and in light of light , over 8 hours . &quot;
&quot; pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
using a sterile sy@@ ringe is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an abra@@ sive Abra@@ x@@ ane water bottle .
&quot; after full en@@ core of the solution , the break @-@ in bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good use of the solid material . &quot;
&quot; then the water bottle should be slowly and carefully turned and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until a complete suspension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itation or sin@@ ks are visible , the water bottle must again be gently inver@@ ted to achieve complete res@@ us@@ ement prior to the application . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose of the 5 mg / ml suspension required for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied : • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pac@@ lit@@ axel or any of the other components of Abra@@ x@@ ane , if you are silent • If your white blood cells are low ( initial values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about this ) &quot;
&quot; special caution when applying Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have impaired kidney function • if you suffer from num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness • If you suffer from severe liver problems , if you have heart problems &quot;
&quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines , please inform the doctor if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine , as these may possibly cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; in addition , they should be advised against the treatment of a sperm count because of the treatment of the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment there is the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility . &quot;

member states must ensure that the holder of the permit for the placing of the market prior to launch provides medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging samples . • With clear imaging of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport by the patient . &quot;
this means that se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &apos; reference drug &apos; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood cell values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood flow rate is not possible before the procedure and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have provided appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no shortage of iron , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or because the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
se@@ amed was compared to a V@@ ene in a study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems and compared with the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to se@@ amed or continued receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ el@@ ly mig@@ ra@@ ine @-@ like headaches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the drug shows a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy , where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical interventions , which require large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , se@@ amed can be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no shortage of iron , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
&quot; H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and disease may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition by the doctor is required . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values may occasionally be observed in patients with ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 3.6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition by the doctor is required . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproductive value of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reproductive value of &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l have risen to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproductive value of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproductive value has increased by &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , and the response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 @-@ 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should receive se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme begins , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ operative 300 I.@@ E. / kg in each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ to@@ sis ( Pure Red Cell A@@ plac@@ sia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ to@@ sis ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not enrolled in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ egi@@ ac or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ to@@ sis ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a decrease in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reproductive value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ um@@ to@@ xi@@ k@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the reproductive value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the reproductive &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and a study of the bone mar@@ row should be weighed for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ic stimul@@ ant agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit deri@@ ving from the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded for maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients under chemotherapy should consider a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
the decision for re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s participation which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated appropriately if possible prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing a major electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery should have adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial limit of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine did not prove that tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; through th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ sis , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can result in th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is the same as the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ ic patients . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ genic and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ ost@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancies . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after IV inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are given 24 hours after the first administration , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; 14 epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fö@@ ld body weight , to a delay in the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports rely on in vitro fer@@ til@@ isation with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;

&quot; prior to the launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorization must provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging samples . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Version 3.0 is set up and functional , before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug used in traffic is applied . &quot;
&quot; the management of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) stipul@@ ated in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as specified in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. , as well as any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan . &quot;
&quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • If new information is received , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk reduction may be achieved within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first occurring or increased chest pain ) , the risk of bleeding in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , a blood type of blood has occurred in the past . &quot;
&quot; in severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with se@@ amed @-@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is rep@@ aid in further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with se@@ amed before beginning treatment . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ to@@ sis after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ to@@ sis , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
therefore se@@ amed by injection must be given to a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of the treatment with se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly in order to keep the risk of drop@@ let formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there have already been th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events in the past ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative influence on the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the start of treatment and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using other medicines / have recently applied / applied , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to ensure the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equal large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating will carry out regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ to@@ sis means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can occur regardless of the treatment with se@@ amed - to a blood c@@ ough formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .

&quot; if a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and has room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered from a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache in the three days after the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for more than 50 years , who recently suffered a frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % , compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without any oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cla@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta should not be used in patients , who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides explanations for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains tips on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ cla@@ sta in the European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year to treat post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta twice a day ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the application of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people of A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data on safety and effectiveness are absent . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experience for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta prior to treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered a tooth analysis with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental interventions , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values found below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was used , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; 7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with an A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in the event of over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric vascular frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density at lum@@ bar verteb@@ ral acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower th@@ igh by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized micro@@ scopy ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
&quot; bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased by BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all points of time . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D over 24 months compared to placebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % in total , and 4.3 % on the lower neck . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study was random@@ ised to 50@@ 8 men , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at the Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was studied in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed disease ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3.6 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic response in 141 patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , can be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; fast bi@@ pha@@ sic van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long phase of elimination with a termin@@ ally Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ s@@ wer@@ ts@@ zeit t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced clearance of metabol@@ ised substances is unlikely to be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzymes , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed for humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , drug @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; as for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was determined by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spontaneous in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
the owners of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all following versions of the R@@ MP approved in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) are required .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP guid@@ eline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence the current statements on the safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days , an important milestone ( for phar@@ ma vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by restoring bone reconstruction back to normal , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / applied / used recently / applied even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are using medicines , which are known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta , together with foods and beverages , you are concerned that you should take sufficient amounts of fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta is effective for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood during the in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can act longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new date . &quot;
&quot; before termin@@ ating the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta if you are considering ending the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of low calorie concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ bing feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , were reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects affects you considerably or you notice side effects not listed in this manual information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture have recently been recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients have to be sufficiently hydr@@ ated ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate supply of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture recently received an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a diet and exercise , A@@ comp@@ lia is used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and moreover one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , there were four trials involving more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s effect on this field of application was difficult to assess . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is required for simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
depres@@ sive reactions can also occur in patients who - apart from obesity - have no noticeable risks .

• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; in addition , there were 3@@ 800 patients in further indications in patients with obes@@ e patients and patients with obesity . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and associated metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only slight symptoms were observed in a study of toler@@ ability in which a limited number of people had given up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year for A@@ comp@@ lia was 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1,2 kg in the placebo group ( difference - 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years the difference in total weight loss between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo was -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 weight reduction and further risk factors In studies in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de of 6.@@ 9 % was seen ( initial value tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients receiving H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference between the average weight change between the 20 mg and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % were explained by weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; 2 hours , the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; the influence of food : in the case of the food intake , it showed a 67 % increase in C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % higher ng AU@@ C in the case of the food intake . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have a reduction of up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following un@@ desirable effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were considered to be relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on the fertility or cycle disturbances were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl @-@ resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl @-@ resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl @-@ resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , so type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ate was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered at doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the trial , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving acet@@ ate in addition to insulin assumed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ der@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently adjusted and which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was carried out .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated output h@@ ep@@ atic cell values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver cells are to be controlled again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal discomfort , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver strains are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued should be led to the pre@@ valence of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl @-@ resin or two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ons , including the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported about an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct correlation between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report blur@@ ring disturbances ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated incidence of frac@@ ture was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceuticals dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the increased insulin resistance of the mother animal in pregnancy decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth . &quot;
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the body and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents over the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range were often seen as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; since the launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were performed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , after 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nucleus recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of improvement with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / Krem@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plastic matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while decreased values were observed under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des as well as the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceuticals dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively br@@ anded pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the fung@@ us ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys concur@@ red with recur@@ rent plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the insulin resistance of the mother animal in the gest@@ ation and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um was induced . &quot;
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of colon@@ ization .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated incidence of frac@@ ture was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined in each case with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies more than 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / Krem@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , both over an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women was demonstrated . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels have been lowered in a similar way to another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of the package contents ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed against the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane within the European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia are less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which go beyond several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients to consult other medicines they have taken .

diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
&quot; 5 Inten@@ si@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar , however , may be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia bodies with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is intraven@@ ously given by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of the work lasts up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster and delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insul@@ in@@ molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on the conventional safety test studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

acet@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are bl@@ ended , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin which is long acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go beyond several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

the cap of your Flex@@ Pen is always set up if it is not in use to protect it from light .
F Ke@@ ep up the flex @-@ pen with the injection needle and kno@@ ck a few times with the finger on the cartridge so that existing air bubbles collect in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge .
&quot; the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards , by turning the dose @-@ on knob in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is on the dose indication . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h no@@ des ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger rock fragments that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; this is why it is recommended that patients with aden@@ omas at least during the first six months of treatment have other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atism . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ uria ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once a day consisted of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) in the last three measurements an ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ uria ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with heart problems in pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia in diseases that have already lead to ur@@ ate deposits ( including a rheum@@ atism , known or currently available from the medical history and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since children and youths do not have any experiences , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; since organ transplan@@ t recipients do not have any experiences , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure is not recommended with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other res@@ inous medicines , it is possible to get acute rheum@@ atic attacks during the treatment process because of the lowering of serum acid levels , ur@@ ic acid deposits can first be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical studies , minor symptoms of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the start of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ oping treatment and in the further course of the liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times a day associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ of@@ aci@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
&quot; in a study involving subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x conducted a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ um containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , slow@@ ed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and reduced the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant changes in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies does not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or when exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator , compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group , was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic illness and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects , which were reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical studies , no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year were treated with 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the subsequent treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally . &quot;
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all at the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 , or with a lower frequency : &quot;
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ esth@@ esia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te numbers , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the action mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism in humans and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
the effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients , in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and sustained long @-@ term throughout the entire treatment .
&quot; in 50@@ 9 patients , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol received 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dysfunction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data collected in two years from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des until the month 24 . &quot;
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses ranging from 120 mg to 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of serum acid concentration if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at plasma bonding is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed mainly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id origin@@ ates mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the stool as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total @-@ AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times from 7.5 μ y / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ¼ h / ml in the group , with severe kidney function . &quot;
12 liver function restriction After ing@@ es@@ tion of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility in male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly d@@ osed treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; at high doses , which were approximately in the four@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a decrease in the performance capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as the drug is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to risk management systems for human medicine with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • when new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk minim@@ ization • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine - if you have a heart failure or suffer from another heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer or a Les@@ ch @-@ ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital condition in which too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) .
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before starting with the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the related symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using other medicines / have recently applied / applied , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking drugs / use one of the following substances as interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ c@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood di@@ lution in heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you are suffering from certain sugar@@ s . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines , which are approved in the European Union , the Company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data to indicate that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same dose , required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscle , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( difficulty swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic sensation . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be followed precisely in order to reduce the risk of malign@@ ant irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day that should be taken at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can only be given special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the seizure of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out to remedy the medicine at the onset of symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn . &quot;
3 The risk of severe malign@@ ant side @-@ effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to use it after symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens contains predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
there is no data available to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy for patients who require a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets the same day , but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases that affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
nevertheless decreases of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ follow a oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , op@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main action of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of calcium and phosph@@ ate , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo was 6.2 % ) in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate score by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability was reduced to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful changes in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats showed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after IV administration , but then quickly spread in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; after IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects . &quot;
&quot; after an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ances did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( females and men ) , after the application of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before the intake of a meal , the mean surface under the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) was 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) . &quot;

&quot; characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as well as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly elevated cou@@ l@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; because of clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over @-@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; formulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be controlled prior to change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as tal@@ low mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night @-@ ran@@ ational phase .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose can take several days until the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral intake of drugs in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily administration in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabil@@ isation after transplantation . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily administration in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust must be converted from twice daily dosing of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , must be done . &quot;
&quot; after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
&quot; heart transplan@@ t For adult patients , who are switched to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft receptor although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ enti@@ a in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal patients , came to an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in pancre@@ atic patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
can adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose .
&quot; since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels of serum , a calculation of the cre@@ atine pill and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood tal@@ low of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ enti@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or simultaneous use of substances which could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the Tal@@ ks do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the seb@@ ac@@ ia of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood is usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were generally used in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over @-@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; formulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t receivers and gra@@ ft receivers in childhood , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to lowering the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with adv@@ enti@@ f is to be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a corneal or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy could be observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , liquid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , Sal@@ ardi@@ ert , L@@ act@@ ose contain , special caution is offered in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with anti@@ fung@@ al such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the hei@@ gh@@ tened oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal flu@@ e metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , and thus increase the exposure of the hormone , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive actions are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of patients on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; subsequently , the side effects are listed in decreasing order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

cases of BK virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with advance .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed evacu@@ ated rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks in the advance group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
&quot; patient survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) died . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of adv@@ enti@@ f and pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t receivers . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for advance and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were deaths . &quot;

&quot; incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 females , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) died . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agent for pancre@@ atic , pul@@ mon@@ ary and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 eyes transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an enem@@ a transplan@@ t were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ es et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases resulted in the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly bigger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ es et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ a- syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal gra@@ ft showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection methods of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus which lead to seb@@ ac@@ eous humor ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the non@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;

advance is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ances are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advance is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures has been studied . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic iso@@ des was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advance must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transfer of lawyers across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment course , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended to determine the factor VI@@ II plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; in response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients may differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods . &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A doses can be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a proper dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed . &quot;
&quot; the dosage speed should be directed at the patient &apos;s condition , and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ posi@@ tional days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esi@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tr@@ i ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VI@@ II is not present during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; in the largest number of patients , A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients showing a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ke occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , no one of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated from the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , lit@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ des reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co@@ p factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex into the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are usually affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been altered in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and thus can cause no infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , allowing the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions posed by him , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors is beneficial for patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compound @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents under 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ol is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ oned . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may cause con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who took aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who did Des@@ cent alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disturbances and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) , cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ os@@ ols across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cutting , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ ation should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms cease .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if required . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ ol@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in the event of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a gain of headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ dati@@ d ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ation is to be removed at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ cent adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ cent were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or@@ ical tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ cent adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate , nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not result in increasing the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a presum@@ ption that may lead to impairment of the ability to transport or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult muscle tension , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ecular P sel@@ ector on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was noted . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ cent adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study carried out with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , it is possible to be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane or to be pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases may occur or are diagnosed with you under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Cardi@@ ovascular disorders • Cardi@@ ovascular disorders • nausea , headache , or a strengthening of existing headaches . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for use in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze conduc@@ ts di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ ol than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you suffer significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
&quot; heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ett@@ le rash and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ests , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , in cases of liver inflammation and in cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by identifying symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , impairment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptom scores ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ ul@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ cent adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be stopped after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of traffic conditions or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was headache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n and with 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ecular P sel@@ ector on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all the ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria can lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of lit@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ cent in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of the patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo not only C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate , nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ cent adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ cent adi@@ n reveal no particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ peg , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ po@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ amma , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , for reli@@ eving symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , that are restricted to metabolic , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not take . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more adverse events in patients treated with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ cent ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily di@@ chlor@@ ate dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was noted . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents showed no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions in adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment and an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of lit@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted to metabolic .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , the recommended doses of AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x were comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bre@@ glass bottles with child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once a day , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ at@@ ate can be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;

&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated and this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was noted . &quot;
&quot; in case of a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of the patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put into the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ cent adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before applying , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the dis@@ car@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not decrease significantly from the safety profile specified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the accept@@ ability formulation of des@@ al@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ sem@@ ination of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was , however , not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined for pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dosage studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 . &quot;

at the recommended dose A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of melting tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the decreasing formulation of des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a 30 single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;

&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of the prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical trial tests for the melt tablet found that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lo@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , that are restricted to metabolic , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ - intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ cent @-@ adi@@ n group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported as placebo reported diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 at a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was noted . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; because A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n contains , no biological valence study was required and it is expected that it comp@@ lies with the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. issued an official approval to the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the membrane shell of the virus was cleaned with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for taking , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the probability has assessed that the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this drug , enhanced with low doses , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier . &quot;
main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml under as@@ gener@@ ase after 48 weeks , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who earlier had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ irrit@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other protein inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under as@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger de@@ bris of the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who took their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer further : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blo@@ ating ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded as well as as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take as@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing as@@ gener@@ ase within the European Union . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r are administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for dispos@@ ing is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
&quot; 2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of ri@@ p@@ am@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protein inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase may not be given concur@@ r@@ ently with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
plant preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially fatal results .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with previously reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects , including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended to admini@@ ster as@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the as@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ foli@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses whose therapy medicines needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B . higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ts , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; with hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis are reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ irrit@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects were often observed on the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient has already received St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) , C@@ MA@@ x was increased by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were administered twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % humili@@ ated if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study on the use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the in@@ viol@@ able component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see the ant@@ acids below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ virus may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is necessary ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ viruses are difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous addition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could increase the plasma levels of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ density ) once daily with no simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may , if used together with as@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it may result in resor@@ ption disorders .
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as the enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluid cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous addition of as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment prev@@ ails the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase plasma levels while ad@@ minist@@ ering as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma concentrations of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended until stabil@@ isation of the mirror , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with the associated mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am um 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , such as the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dosage , if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time administered by as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ k@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the mon@@ ni@@ cation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most adverse events associated with the treatment of as@@ gener@@ ase were mild to moderate , followed early and rarely led to treatment ab@@ rup@@ ture . &quot;
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another drug applied at the same time or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
&quot; most of the side @-@ effects listed below originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ al fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s treated 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin rash was usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or lean @-@ pap@@ ered nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low @-@ dose ri@@ p@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the incidence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ formation stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % in@@ hibition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells &quot;
the relationship between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely have been observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) , patients treated with protein inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks with the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ say mut@@ ations : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic data based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( dividing points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other protein inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients , with which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus failed ( one of 25 Isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other protein @-@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a caus@@ ative therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults received after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ slip wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the medium duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , C@@ MA@@ x was reduced by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be ruled out by a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution if they are given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of kidney dysfunction can be minimal to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , twice daily , without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , en@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which were equivalent to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there are little indications of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests at human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed that indicate delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of ri@@ p@@ am@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts , such as longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) , C@@ MA@@ x was increased by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is necessary ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ viruses are difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;

&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the concur@@ rent administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the mon@@ ni@@ cation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % in@@ hibition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other protein @-@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution if they are given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , en@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were observed in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans twice daily administered by 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , there were little indications of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metabol@@ isation paths are not fully mature so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . )
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age are shown . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting was neither covered with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for dispos@@ ing is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules with taking the solution to stop taking ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for the intake and low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient populations . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for use in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for use in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of sending HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .

&quot; if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) , C@@ MA@@ x was increased by 30 % . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is unknown . as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ k@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the mon@@ ni@@ cation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another drug applied at the same time or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .

&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ak@@ ine ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream continues until all visible tendencies are missing in the genital or peri@@ canal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; in case of follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the lesi@@ ons treated should only be completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the cleaned , infected skin area , until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a balancing act between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
there should be a balancing act between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with one of the leading strokes were observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; until now , no clinical experience is required to treat I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following treatment with other sub@@ cut@@ aneous remedies in the genital and peripheral area . &quot;
&quot; although limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream showed less effectiveness in this patient group regarding the elimination of incl@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during the therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged by the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is required , therefore the application of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical passages outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the in@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually take effect during the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be obtained , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly shared and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of incl@@ ines ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the reported side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III are shown below .
&quot; in these studies , the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the test plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , exposure ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe mold growth and shor@@ tening ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies to investigate the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ adver@@ tent oral absorption of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of incl@@ ines in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of the patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients were completely absent ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks per week was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications Occ@@ asion , ak@@ in ker@@ at@@ osis , and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma normally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and have therefore not been investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentration of drugs in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0,1 , 0,2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the estimated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study , which points to prolonged retention of the drug in the skin . &quot;
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to sp@@ le@@ en ; a study on der@@ mal application had no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during the mal@@ administration three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors performed in the group of mice that were treated with the adhesive @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; if left untreated , it can lead to distortion , especially in the face - so early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ak@@ in ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people exposed to much of the solar radiation during their lives . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in the face and scal@@ p of patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor about this before you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream first if the area to be treated is cured after a previous drug or surgical treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact the cream is removed by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o W@@ end the cream not in@@ war@@ dly . o If reactions occur in the treated area , which cause you severe discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue treatment . o Find your doctor if they have no normal blood pattern &quot;

&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream to the clean , dry skin area with the skins and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin need to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .

&quot; if your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , do not use the cream further , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells may cause you to be more prone to infection ; it can cause a blue stain to develop sooner or it can cause fatigue .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects affects you considerably or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , these are lighter skin reactions that disappear within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment is completed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the place of application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , de@@ formation , skin irritation , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ating movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines before administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was examined mainly , but its efficacy was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over 5 years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of the lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated rate of heart ) , fever and shi@@ vers . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will examine all new information that may be known , and , if necessary , update this summary . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study it is expected that virtually all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment , caution must be taken cau@@ ti@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ gi@@ ants ) , to minimize the potential occur@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there is no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mostly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ associated involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath @-@ still@@ ness and visual o@@ ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desired Drug Eff@@ ects in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form and duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
most patients had a ser@@ o@@ conversion rate within 3 months of treatment with a more severe form of disease in the patients aged 5 years ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to an early withdrawal from the trial ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect det@@ ectable antibodies by radio@@ immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ atory ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to server conversion . &quot;
&quot; patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ hood @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of diseases , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms showed an improvement in lung function compared to the placebo group , which is shown in the following table . &quot;
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as emerged from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with an H@@ ep@@ Atom@@ ic aber@@ ration before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG level in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients who were taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes spann@@ ed across five effects ( normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement area of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally observed in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the middle form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a magnitude growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were noted after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . the younger patients with the severe form of form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no advances in cognitive development were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk were carried out . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that in elderly and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional safety assessment studies , toxic@@ ity in a one @-@ off gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be bl@@ ended with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6. &quot;

&quot; within the specified time , the owner of the transaction has concluded the following program of studies , whose results are the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk relationship . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , this tab will record safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction occurred on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical staff ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - condition of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath @-@ still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash , joint pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Stim@@ ulation • hyper@@ ton@@ ia • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion station &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used along with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body , or is likely to spread to other parts of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ medication &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months with the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ axel within 7.@@ 9 months . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells had longer survival times in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union . &quot;
each bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary dos@@ - sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ cl@@ onal bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with locom@@ oti@@ ves of advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed administration , as well as the day after treatment , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine drink ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times higher than the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose examination must take place taking account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients do not develop ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
&quot; treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped , if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continuing with the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical studies have shown no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or in comparison to patients under 65 years of age there is an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require any dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or tran@@ sit@@ ine values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te value once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ gh@@ e@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ ached when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days prior to the treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients scheduled for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ er@@ ci@@ ve before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be weighed in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space . &quot;
&quot; 5 Sever@@ e cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( excluding yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice on sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice on the locking of semen . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma , and the random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed - and 163 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; side effects Frequ@@ ency indicators : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( on the basis of available data of spontan@@ eity ) . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ities reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were dealt with su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three single P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Mon@@ other@@ api@@ studies , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , which random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC , random@@ ised to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ities , which were reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( frequently ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included : &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ities reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed were :
&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in hospitals with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ e@@ litis ) . &quot;
&quot; from clinical studies , patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ sep@@ tic , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ l@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ re@@ duk@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural otheli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage over those patients who were only cur@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy showed medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ disc epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the products . &quot;
&quot; it is applied to overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats that are fed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients with an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stepped bow@@ el , stud thread , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) , or in chol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic drug may be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take extra pregn@@ ancies , in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma cones was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at for up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , and very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of reported side effects , which were noted after the or@@ list@@ at market launch , is not known as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 m@@ g. three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in most cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects can be traced back to or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ very @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties . &quot;
the therapeutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ e and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot;
average total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.3 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting point 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in therapeutic doses , non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study involving obes@@ e patients ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can no longer be identified . &quot;

&quot; for more useful information on the blue pages , see section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or a meal contains no fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work when the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , you risk nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your new eating habits , start your first capsule collection with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand what you eat and how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your eating habits .
&quot; to ensure your target weight is safe , you should set up two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
eat fatty acid to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity .
&quot; • If you cannot detect any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about turning the diet short @-@ term and then returning to the old habits . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you suffer significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment , since you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional defici@@ encies : • Start some days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a rich desserts , as you might experience it with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot;
• Store away from moisture . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ fung@@ al medicine ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ e showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , moderate nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ e showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ is is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of al@@ op@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute id should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable with simultaneous treatment of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs that were directed against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the most common adverse events in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with alo@@ xi @-@ related headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were shown as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind trials , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 of do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study showed a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to extend the duration of the shareholder &apos;s potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of p@@ alli@@ ative pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption After IV administration , an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the average ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50 % are transformed into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron for less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the iso@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous pin injection , the total body total was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elim@@ inations and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies effects were observed only by expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which suggests a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization , and can pro@@ long the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for the human being . &quot;
the holder of this permit for the placing of the market must inform the European Commission of the plans for the placing of the drug approved as part of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the announcement of approval for the marketing of hepatitis C medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C related to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon , the disease improved again in more patients than with the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far this drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected slides ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ eal Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms against this type of infection may not work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had disappeared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it has been noted that in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( iron @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , it is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections prevail against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small charging , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped off and appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the medi@@ an Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve on the skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fo@@ etal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go applied , was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the date of departure which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance obtained by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial belt , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer Center .
&quot; by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partially blocking P bin@@ dings and preventing the normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , consultation by experts should be sought . &quot;
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of failure to respond to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stems with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and ton@@ ed skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sage twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling procedure was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of shiel@@ ded skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ yos study of rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were noted . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be completed . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix took a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations of hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month and 12 @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ernity ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of the choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if the vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ ologically competent people who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended to contain 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that additional vacc@@ ines can be required in these cases . &quot;
&quot; because intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can , however , be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as in these cases there can be bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us flu vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever occurred similar to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ ery and preserv@@ ative formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and quality on a calculation basis per imm@@ uni@@ ation dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects according to the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % for the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ urities per Pro@@ band was comparable high ( i.e. throughout the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % for the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ence group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; during the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
&quot; in clinical studies carried out in the vaccine at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination formula containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the absorption of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after resor@@ ting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state char@@ itable sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as swimming in contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus before the doses of both doses ( although you / your child may not feel ill or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause damage to the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / her child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you need to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician will advise you / her child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine to you / your child ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; if you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defense / or if you / her child are undergoing hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , or if you / her child are undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her / her child . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many as possible limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; very common ( more than one case per 10 ver@@ aged doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite , &quot;
&quot; • Frequ@@ ency ( up to 1 case per 10 recorded doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • F@@ ever ( over 38 ° C ) • Per@@ di@@ gest@@ ed , gastro@@ intestinal disorders &quot;
&quot; other side effects reported few days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 recorded doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extended out@@ ings that may itch or infl@@ ate , swelling of the eye and face , da@@ zz@@ ing breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure loss and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like discomfort , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain , var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , di@@ zz@@ iness , ail@@ ments such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , dis@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects affects you / your child significantly or you notice side effects not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has been known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only brought to traffic in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine are limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is administered - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered by a gastro@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo ( i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; it may also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , loss of taste or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant odor of the body or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this medicine was available . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a delayed manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , an indication exists for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein up@@ take of the patient for the growth and development . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency in a dose of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day must be obtained with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal deficiency .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing because there is a risk for the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate are spread over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in humans is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate cell , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an in@@ adver@@ tent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
&quot; for this reason , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diets and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a delayed manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated manifestations of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were observed .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not demon@@ stra@@ bly det@@ ectable in the plasma in the following morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma torch were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no compla@@ ining effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not yet swallow tablets or give patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ ia or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in babies , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there were lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain @-@ bark . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate cell , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nutrients . &quot;
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ulate form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined 15 minutes after the ing@@ es@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot separate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disorders , dis@@ ruption of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in blood vision ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , skin rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you suffer significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
&quot; according to the exp@@ iry date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can no longer be used according to the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on and the container . &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and content of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are performed , tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS or@@ ally or over a stomach fever ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the rim of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules out of the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an abnormal measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared to single administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug used to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) and a G@@ PI ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients were often a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as de@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , Angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - was just as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST recovery inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention will be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and intraven@@ ously administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney dysfunction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ fi@@ denti@@ ru@@ din vs. AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din joint without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of lower @-@ molecular lifting .
• severe un@@ controlled hypertension and acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if most of the blood counts on arter@@ ial points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform ble@@ ed@@ ings in principle . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is achieved again before treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation ) , these agents can increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in combination with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding such as table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : in@@ tra @-@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the pun@@ cture area , reducing ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations performed by more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ fi@@ denti@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ fi@@ denti@@ ru@@ din is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient will be closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ fi@@ denti@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ inic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the ani@@ on bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and there@@ with its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part slowly spl@@ its the binding of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ fi@@ denti@@ ru@@ din was not able to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and conc@@ entri@@ c anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is documented by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ fi@@ denti@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention will be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography in 72 hours . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ fi@@ denti@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs , or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or can &apos;t process insulin effectively .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it affects faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where insulin cannot be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin is determined . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous via continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin needs in patients can be reduced by limiting the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effect of the action , the brand ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can cause a change in the need for insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or the departure of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of the emergence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
&quot; the substances which increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effects of symp@@ a@@ thetic medicine such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pine may be weakened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ in enters human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is demonstrated in the therapeutic relevant dosing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al action , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ in has twice as fast effects as normal human insulin and achieves full glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that a similar post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of is@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , like with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; when insulin secre@@ tion was applied 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; when insulin l@@ ul@@ ins are applied 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as in human @-@ controlled insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is given in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ in in administration 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
