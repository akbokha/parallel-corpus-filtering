<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • bipolar-I disorder, a psychological illness in which patients have alternating episodes (periods of anorexia) alternating with periods of normal sentiment."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to control increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution to disposing or the melting tablets can be applied in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are also broken down as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" "neurotransmitters", "i.e., chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl is believed to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalize the brain's activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients, where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients addressing the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased more effectively in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, up to 74 weeks ago, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"even more effective than placebo, Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled shrinkage), headaches, blurred vision, vomiting, nausea, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mostly manic episodes, outweighing the manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd a permit for the launch of Abilify across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">"abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes, and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven."</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after menopause, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazl should be used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transition disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malign form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late-dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesired cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is necessary if Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazl, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisation."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint administration of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate rise in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphian / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextromethacrylan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on it."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study for over 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole were reduced (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olandestin therapy."</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and have been reported in the treatment with Aripiprazl include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without cause of death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although no information on the efficacy of hemodialysis is present in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazl, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose, as Aripiprazl has a high plasma bonding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazl showed a high affinity with the dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, to alpha-1-adrenergigen and to the histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"administered by Aripiprazl in dosages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and on the putty."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients, who attended a response to study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rates, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher reduction of the relapse rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olandestine-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks which comprised 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) occurred with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy that was superior to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"furthermore, in week 12, Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl showed herself superior to the prevention of a bipolar disorder, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion and hydroxyation of Aripiprazl, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">"the mean elioration time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl, with extensive metabolisation over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism via CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazl, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A study-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics found no indication of clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) and combined adrenal rinds (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes).</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulphonyl-resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonyl-resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulphonyl-resin or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, so type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acetate was studied in tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered at doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the trial, the effect of the additional administration of acettos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl resin was reduced by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients receiving acetate in addition to insulin assumed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoderthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">"in October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for the placing of Actos in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="763">"the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" 15 "and on the other side the inscription" Actos. ""</seg>
<seg id="764">"pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficiently adjusted and which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="765">"no data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. past heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose."</seg>
<seg id="767">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve."</seg>
<seg id="768">"patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">"this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study."</seg>
<seg id="771">"in patients with elevated output hepatic cell values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range), or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used."</seg>
<seg id="772">"if the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver cells are to be controlled again as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="773">"if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver strains are to be checked."</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should be continued should be led to the prevalence of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">"in clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention."</seg>
<seg id="776">"as a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction in the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with pioglitazone."</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4%) and haematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">"as a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with a sulphonyl-resin or two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="779">"after the market launch, the treatment with thiazolid indions, including the pioglitazone, was reported about an occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity."</seg>
<seg id="780">"it is unclear whether there is a direct correlation between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report blurring disturbances; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="781">"in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone"</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated incidence of fracture was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">"in the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6)."</seg>
<seg id="785">"studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceuticals dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="786">"drug interactions that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected."</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone by the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction of the AUC by Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is due to the fact that, under treatment with pioglitazone, the increased insulin resistance of the mother animal in pregnancy decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for foetal growth."</seg>
<seg id="790">"very often &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from this data)."</seg>
<seg id="791">"these lead to a temporary change in the body and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents."</seg>
<seg id="792">"in clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT ascents over the triples of the upper limit of the normal range were often seen as placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea."</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">"since the launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="795">"a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the treated groups."</seg>
<seg id="796">"in the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were performed in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="797">"when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, after 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared."</seg>
<seg id="798">"Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nucleus receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ), which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazon reduces glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to the release of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">"at the time after two years of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazid)."</seg>
<seg id="802">"in a placebo-controlled study for more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of improvement with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="803">"in patients under Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed."</seg>
<seg id="804">"in clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decline in the albumin / Krematinin quotient was statistically significant compared to baseline values."</seg>
<seg id="805">"the effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics."</seg>
<seg id="806">"in most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slight, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed."</seg>
<seg id="807">"in clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plastic matriglycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol."</seg>
<seg id="808">"in comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazon, while decreased values were observed under Metformin and Gliclazid."</seg>
<seg id="809">"in a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglycerides as well as the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="810">"in the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups that received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="811">"after oral use, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application."</seg>
<seg id="812">"on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="813">"in interaction studies, pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceuticals dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively branded pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the fungus (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">"the mean plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours."</seg>
<seg id="817">"the plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearances of the parent substance are similar."</seg>
<seg id="818">"in toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys concurred with recurrent plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy."</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the insulin resistance of the mother animal in the gestation and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">"in long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced."</seg>

<seg id="824">"in the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication."</seg>
<seg id="825">"in another study for two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined in each case with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid."</seg>
<seg id="826">"in clinical studies more than 1 year, under Pioglitazon, statistically significant decline in the albumin / Krematinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values."</seg>
<seg id="827">"in a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglycerides, both over an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic trygliceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="828">"although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazon."</seg>

<seg id="1638">"based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="1639">"therefore, on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"in December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company takes its application for the marketing of Advex into the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1641">"however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are usually affected."</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"the virus in Advex is an" Adenovirus, "which has been altered in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and thus can cause no infections in humans."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumors, allowing the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"the p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered."</seg>
<seg id="1646">"in the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide."</seg>
<seg id="1647">"the company presented data from a study with a patient, in which Li-Fraumeni cancer appeared in the area of the lower abdomen, bones and brain."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"after the CHMP had examined the company's answers to the questions posed by him, some questions were still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1649">"based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"according to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors is beneficial for patients."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient."</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compound-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed drug release" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents under 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerosol is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cloned."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may cause constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, patients who took aerosaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients with aerobaze showed a reduction in symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who did Descent alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (somnolence), sleep disturbances and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to Descent-adin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies), cannot be applied."</seg>

<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aerosols across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without cutting, breaking or chewing)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeration should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms cease.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if required."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the drug is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergoline, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, napololin, etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">"patients must be informed that treatment in the event of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a gain of headache) must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, hydatid obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"aeration is to be removed at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions."</seg>

<seg id="1682">"in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"the harmlessness of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not result in increasing the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans, and because of the vasoconstric properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be used in pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a presumption that may lead to impairment of the ability to transport or the ability to operate machinery."</seg>

<seg id="1690">"in a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjectively drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying."</seg>
<seg id="1691">"in controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was noted."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"the oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"there were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerobaze tablets."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"in both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerobaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucous swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"the efficacy of aerobaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Descent adin over the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"the efficacy of aerobaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnic origin."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"in the course of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"after the peroral application of aerobaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of desloatadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in the context of a pharmacokinetic multidose study carried out with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects of Descent-adin were poorly metabolised."</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine is equivalent to exposure to an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"however, based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Descent-adin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine."</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as" foreign "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"as a result, the immune system is later able to form antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"afterwards, the membrane shell of the virus was cleaned with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">"as a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines."</seg>

<seg id="1905">"for patients who cannot swallow the capsules, asgenerase is available as a solution for taking, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"asgenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined what antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the probability has assessed that the virus will respond to the medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1907">"the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral medicines."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"in combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"this drug, enhanced with low doses, was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors earlier."</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"in the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml under asgenerase after 48 weeks, but asgenerase was less effective than indinavir."</seg>
<seg id="1915">"in children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who earlier had been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1916">"in the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Airritase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other protein inhibitors:"</seg>
<seg id="1917">"in the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under asgenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger debris of the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who took their previous proteasehemmer further:"</seg>
<seg id="1918">"the most common side effects of asgenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (bloating), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">"asgenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines, which are degraded as well as asgenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"as with other medicines for HIV, patients who take asgenerase are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system)."</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"asgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor is not proven."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"Agenerase was originally admitted under" "exceptional circumstances" "since only limited information was available for scientific reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"in October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for placing asgenerase within the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"asgenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasehemmer (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules for pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir are administered together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pretreatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">"the bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for disposing is 14% lower than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, asgenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see section 5.2)."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the announcement of approval for the marketing of hepatitis C medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that alpheeon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference drug" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"Alpheon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the study was measured, how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood)."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"in addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C related to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting the treatment with Alpheeon, the disease improved again in more patients than with the reference drug, and Alpheon also had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from that, the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far this drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine), is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected slides (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewed wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, which have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillineal Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms against this type of infection may not work."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients aged nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had disappeared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it has been noted that in the treatment of abscesses (iron-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA, it is not effective enough."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections prevail against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small charging, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the ointment should be carefully wiped off and appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials in secondary open wounds, the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 According to oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole, the median Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salve on the skin of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and foetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamines Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo applied, was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the date of departure which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance obtained by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial belt, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the PeptidylTransfer Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, partially blocking P bindings and preventing the normal formation of active 50 ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"if, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of reapamulin at least some infection forms should appear questionable, consultation by experts should be sought."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of failure to respond to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of stems with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and toned skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"from 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Sage twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling procedure was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 shielded skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2709">"metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro test on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphooma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkernel test for in-vivo-examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">"there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of shielded skin):"</seg>
<seg id="2713">"in an embryos study of rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were noted."</seg>
<seg id="2714">"the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2), works and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied."</seg>
<seg id="2715">"the owner of the marketing authorization commits to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"as described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Drugs for Humuse, the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report."</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">"do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"it must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"when the ointment looks out on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor about advice if symptoms occur."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"after applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunisation, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be completed."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defences) as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the use of Twinrix adults were also used as proof for the use of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations of hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month and 12-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maternity (tiredness) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for priming with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of the choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if the vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured whether immunologically competent people who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccine, need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended to contain 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value, so that additional vaccines can be required in these cases."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"because intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal implication, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, Ambirix can, however, be injected subcutaneously, as in these cases there can be bleeding after intramuscular administration."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"if Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus flu vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">"in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever occurred similar to the frequency observed in earlier thiomery and preservative formulation."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"in clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and quality on a calculation basis per immuniation dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person."</seg>
<seg id="2754">"pain was observed after the application of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects according to the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"after the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% for the subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"however, the frequency of maturities per Proband was comparable high (i.e. throughout the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% for the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine)."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maternity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">"in a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambience group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2759">"during the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per Proband, was reported."</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with 360 ELISA- units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">"in clinical studies carried out in the vaccine at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7)."</seg>
<seg id="2762">"the serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74,2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7)."</seg>
<seg id="2763">"7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the serum rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3-dose vaccine higher than with Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2765">"the immune response, which was achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds a month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table."</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination formula containing 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">"the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml."</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"if the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the absorption of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB), the immune response to all antigens was sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates similar to earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia mic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"ammonia is administered - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered by a gastrostomia (through the abdominal wall into the stomach-leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube)."</seg>
<seg id="2809">"it was not a comparative study, since ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo (i.e. without active ingredient)."</seg>
<seg id="2810">"it may also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, loss of taste or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant odor of the body or weight gain."</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"Ammonia was approved under" exceptional circumstances, "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, only limited information on this medicine was available."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"the use is indicated in all patients, where a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life)."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in patients with a delayed manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first months of life), an indication exists for use when a hyperammonic encephalopathy exists in anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"for infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"the daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein uptake of the patient for the growth and development."</seg>
<seg id="2817">"according to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults."</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transluamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine deficiency in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day must be obtained with arginine osuccinatal deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing because there is a risk for the development of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose."</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or serious renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">"as metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate are spread over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure."</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">"in subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal propagation and increased loss of neurons."</seg>

<seg id="2827">"it could not be determined whether phenylacetate in humans is excreted into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3)."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs, or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or can't process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it affects faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where insulin cannot be effectively processed, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin is determined."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or to apply subcutaneous via continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin needs in patients can be reduced by limiting the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the effect of the action, the brand (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can cause a change in the need for insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A inadequate dosage or the departure of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-related diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the emergence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances which increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia are oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
