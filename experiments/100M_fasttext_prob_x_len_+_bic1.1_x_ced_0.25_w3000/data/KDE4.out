&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by readily available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... Open the card holders and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that more modules may be on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Canc@@ el . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the module View Fil@@ ters ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : &quot; &quot; all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is defined in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles feature meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the picture of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display ( where therefore display errors are caused by limitations in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target is not always observed . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for the cap@@ tion and to avoid space losses through the frame , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the image gallery module , a dialog opens where you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line option has a slider and a turn@@ table to adjust the number of mini@@ images of each row in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box , show the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , determine if the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nail in the gallery . &quot;

&quot; with the sub@@ folder check box , you can adjust the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the check box , copy the original pictures and determine if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; an easy to use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; edit ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing skills can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; edited ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with substantially more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens to be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; when you are in the program , the Help menu will open a page in the error report system . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all the information you need is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to discover news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to take part in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for sign@@ aling in the developer mailing list of &amp; edited ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where to store your images and your database . simply enter your path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many files as you want . &amp; edited ; you will additionally use as a legacy library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as the base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; edited ; thir@@ sting recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it &apos;s in hidden folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ kl@@ ist do not have photos as symbols . you can change that by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Melo@@ dy lists to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data backup : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it may also work with it . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy to use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; edit ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plugin Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function , than the changes in &amp; edited ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - A file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . this allows filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed , you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or by the date when the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you will be used to sort your photos after collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums Fol@@ lowing collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used if you sort your albums by date with view albums after date .
&quot; the buttons elder , average , new : these set the date to the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the album &quot; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; &quot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window provides the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview with the two lu@@ pin buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information these are , you can edit about settings ; set up . select the albums page and customize the area preview images to suit your needs . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails have help buttons , which appear . if you leave the mouse cur@@ sor a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window . &quot;
&quot; pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to it . you can choose from the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... select a guide how to edit your photos . image editing lets you view and edit your photos .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by controlling the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the File Type sub @-@ menu . to do so , and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click on the right mouse button to click on the preview , and select &quot; &quot; Rot@@ ate &quot; . &quot; in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My date lists ; organize your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; edited ; either use the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with keyword provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you click a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ t@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself is not deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a stit@@ ch by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping there . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as a night@@ time preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag and drop them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can assign a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword to each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have marked a photo with keywords , it will appear in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button , and select from the menu Rem@@ ove menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if you haven &apos;t found the search , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which will always filter what you entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , press OK and the search will be done . the results will be used in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your search again , select the corresponding entry from the view My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select Search , the form to enter the search appears again with the search information entered before . if you select Add As Exten@@ ded Search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu Search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; edited ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules will be added and deleted by operators . each option can be added with other search group / Search group . furthermore , you can create searching the Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar records : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; edited ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab displays an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window that lets you easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add to the illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and open its window . if you are back in &amp; edit ; main window are you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Tools .
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window and place them there . if you select preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform zo@@ oming operations at one of the images , then they are also executed with the other image . so you can compare the same area of both pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you are using combination links from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the image area . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
all image information from the main window &apos;s right side bar is available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can recognize on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the mode preview , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom regulator under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the mode preview .
&quot; digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can back up , find , protect , and use photos again . we view downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , re@@ aming , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; metadata is defined as data about data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to use the metadata for longer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to save the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very quick searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save it to a reserved drive , or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata to be stored in the file &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
now you have a lot of information in your database but what happens if you want to change what ?
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an assessment to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos during the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you frequently mean by other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you bz@@ w the images to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are characteristics of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let most people just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it , catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! one starts to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who regard your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can store as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions will not tell you a second time for the publication . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innum@@ erable and will be deep@@ ening in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys by using images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can also export k@@ ml files to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the furnishing side of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the supplier field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency here offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with machines can delete or modify these images embedded in the image . for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the near future , it will provide such a module for st@@ acking . &quot;
&quot; topics : plate failure , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled cau@@ tious and you may not be trusted for longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; slowly burn the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warranty includes a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks on this subject : flo@@ ppy study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect this error . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s detected errors are the most common cause of failure . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not make a lot of power , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage . in your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause scrat@@ ched key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip , but remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should be careful that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for lap@@ tops and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in investing in an un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over @-@ loop las@@ h@@ ings , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow them even further work until the current runs again . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can get you for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities of data . &quot;
&quot; you are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ f file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate fla@@ ws on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or re @-@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody else for data loss . so , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so backup your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as installing your operating system , replacing plates or changing hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save it one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the latest differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . this creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time where such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync will only dup@@ licate the difference of files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , retained original memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the fewer variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software is available which can be read then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GI@@ F . it is los@@ s@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved colour assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the camera image formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and required for use of metadata .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; which stands for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . however , X@@ MP adap@@ ts as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should decide whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you are editing the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were possibly cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; export the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edit ; in the Add a photo to an album you will be able to add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; for some cameras it may take a while . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer remark , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; edited ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the requested with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have been marked with a star in the preview window until now . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All Download or Sel@@ ected , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; edited ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at one time by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you must select them first and then delete selected ones . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully del@@ eting into a &amp; digi@@ kam . if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do so via the camera system , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos from the camera are deleted . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos from different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been made in the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es . if you use this latter option , a folder is created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you want a different date format than the default format , for example , in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case when you download . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , which &amp; edited ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic turning is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turning in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; edited ; this can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras display this information . in the page bar Met@@ a @-@ data , you can read which information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally turned off , and in this case saved &amp; edited ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option on . use the Advanced button and select the option Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the location data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . the question is actually more how the data in these fields come ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the module for geographic allocation . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry coordinates , such as created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog box is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings , clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
select action can display on embedded thumb@@ nail or set image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should be the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; edited ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save image cap@@ tions as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor rests in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; edited ; tries , you can add and remove file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; when you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings can be set on the default values . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . for this , please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . &quot;
&quot; using the TI@@ FF @-@ files option , you can turn on the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF @-@ images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the sky@@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned into the settings due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as they show the highlights in various ros@@ at@@ ons . last but not least , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible since blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ constructions option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the demo bic@@ ing small , you should go conservative . &quot;
&quot; a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the particle data , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts at the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dation correction , since it is performed during the raw conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; edited ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder Sets the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all of your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; Def@@ ault squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be adapted to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your picture would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print an image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore may seem very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion lets you realize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that have been written to collaborate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then removed by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you can also find some in the context menu of previ@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob regul@@ ates the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera features on the left side show a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button auto detection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set camera models and port manually . after setting up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can select &amp; edit the conversation between &amp; edit ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections Del@@ ete a photo and delete an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries , otherwise you need to save the changes using the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also disable &amp; edit the display of the welcome screen ; under certain circumstances , it will accelerate the start @-@ up process . &quot;
&quot; if something is deleted from the base folder , asked &amp; edited ; if anything is deleted from the base folder , it asks you if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , to customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; edit ; includes a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the ad / edit entry .
&quot; image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it , so you can save it as a file . &quot;
&quot; as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File menu or the Rec@@ over of the Image Processing button . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last save . &quot;
&quot; virtually any image editing action can be revers@@ ed or restored , and the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Rec@@ over or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment for a moment on the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can zoom in and zoom into the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full@@ screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you get to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can edit it in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and receive the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select the Print Ass@@ ist from the menu &quot; &quot; Export Print Ass@@ ist . &quot; &quot; if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation buttons , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab makes the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the label view , you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to rate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC @-@ field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the key @-@ view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords employed previously in this &amp; edited ; -@@ session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , these are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ box keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword ( keyword ) section . &quot;
&quot; the side bar stit@@ ch filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , stit@@ ch and search views . if in addition one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to use keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; you can , for example , set an Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly addressed &amp; edited it ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ administered workflow is that the colors that are displayed or sc@@ anned by your camera or sc@@ anners are the same . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or sc@@ anners , or publish the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is based on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flows ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; their only other picture editions are via email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why do you need to use a different colour space and think about color bl@@ ending ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to install my monitor when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to install your monitor , since s@@ RGB is connected to s@@ RGB . if you work as the color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to install your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile , or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , compare , Automatic offset and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the levels of leu@@ st@@ us over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point are as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
&quot; the same number of pixels achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either works miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
extend contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ b of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited since it is working on a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be viewed in size . on the left side you can see both the original image as well as preview of the target image . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; the hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow Ali@@ gn@@ ment lets you improve or di@@ gest the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it in a text file and load it back later .
&quot; the pres@@ et button sets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and stands only for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool will open the same dialog as the editing of raw pictures . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted the chapter Color Management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under color gra@@ ding correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use them for more photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for tone correction you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was called Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when using a partly developed pressure of a short flash light and later revers@@ ed the development of the image . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ is@@ ation@@ effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and editing the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a movie of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as &apos;s strong saturated colors are also a few photographers especially those who have hardly finished landscapes too much .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . with large images , the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can browse the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; for the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ thickness / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the scope of the slider for the use purpose described here . more concrete the three slide below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn to operate is to shift the controls , and to make sure the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the three color twe@@ ets can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in input parameters . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create an out@@ stretched image as background while something else is in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and re@@ charged later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the entries of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that changes from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode usually creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you post@@ p@@ one a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and the corresponding image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and downloaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cur@@ sor format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , automatically create the verti@@ ces of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colour tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first clu@@ e how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are below : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour . coloured noise files do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer settings for later , then load them . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been newly adjusted . keeping the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a green l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . &quot;
orange Fil@@ l : simulated a black / white film light with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes and maritime scenes and aerial photos .
Rot@@ fil : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate moon light scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ate Filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; Apply tools texture allows you to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a painting or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . the image is surrounded by a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this is also possible at several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . you will need to adjust text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . after the image is saved once , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool sten@@ cil , you can place a template over a picture . &quot;
use the Image Tem@@ plate icon in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set up your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . here , select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the template automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to preview size .
&amp; edited ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
&quot; the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners employ a sharpen@@ ing filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this can be done with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will focus the tool . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image slightly sof@@ tly is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to shar@@ pen and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ate are generated near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius calcul@@ ates how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference to apply for an edge of the filters . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore plastic f@@ law in faces , cel@@ esti@@ al and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; edited ; tool re@@ focusing re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ ters . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focusing usually achieves better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing paint in image editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to merge the image . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use these parameters if your blur@@ ring is pal@@ p@@ able . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ze . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally Un@@ sharp Mas@@ ks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king used a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Line@@ ar Filter . practical is the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the controller smooth@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homo@@ geneous regions smooth@@ ing and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details so that no sharpen@@ ing should be subsequently subordin@@ ated . &quot;
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 .
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . so set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . however , it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to leave it out . &quot;
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how to remove image defects with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act created during the voyage . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&amp; edited ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . if it is increased , noise spi@@ kes are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or for@@ ging occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot remove the entire noise or noise spi@@ kes can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rus@@ hing or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
colour : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ eplay of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically stronger .
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
&quot; sometimes , a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image slightly is much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to shar@@ pen the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t soft drawing and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . &quot;
&amp; edited ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ desirable arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , movie gran@@ ules , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation using the button button at any time . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were created by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; Hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark@@ picture button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to polish these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; cut : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filtering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool for correc@@ ting the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which may increase the necessary sh@@ utter time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gra@@ y@@ scale field of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a picture that has been made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction uses the transformation using a Center@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure to the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the default density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce it to compensate a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor reduces the brightness of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam . image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
&amp; edited ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third gra@@ der has a similar round effect , fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the coefficient corrected the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the second degree of distortion . with negative values , sound @-@ like distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; verti@@ ces &apos; has the opposite character of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value re@@ sc@@ aled the image size and thereby results in a correction of first grade . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
&quot; light values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the tone or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best , you perform this correction as the first . if you cut a picture again and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guides . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some subjects such as images from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can adjust two parameters of film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce the infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ enam@@ el applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; filter movie gran@@ ulation is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ules on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ ements of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ iny effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one in the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny sight , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; edited ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better for large images . smooth@@ es controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with ( 2 ) . pin size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and G@@ lät@@ te 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two controllers with a value range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom knob influences the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &amp; edited ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important to the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
&quot; 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Be@@ iting .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ts the image by random shifting of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an invol@@ un@@ tarily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the paint tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
&quot; some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Be@@ iting . &quot;
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
&quot; you can choose with the &amp; edit ; image editing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirr@@ oring or turning into the correct orientation . &quot;
photo blown is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of picture quality .
the big question is how can you capture a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change . choose to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below . &quot;
&quot; change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad are used exactly for this purpose . each entry for photo enlar@@ ges can be saved as a text file , and re@@ charged later . &quot;
&quot; taking a photo is very fast with what it is doing , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation using the button button at any time . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compose a picture . to cut a photo you just have to use the mouse to create just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and tigh@@ tening the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Move side ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max ratio button to cut the area to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the cooperation help make it possible to show help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ third , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonious tri@@ angles to the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden centre : the golden centre is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divisions in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden centre provides more fluid lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results to your goal . compared to the third @-@ party gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the above discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can make a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographer . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options and verti@@ ces can be mirr@@ ored to reflect the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider back to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cutting out of image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally Cut . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed domain .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed domain .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed domain .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed domain .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ welcome tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting from image processing . &quot;
&quot; using other words , a rect@@ angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . in other words , a rect@@ angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two she@@ eting produces twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the coating , the image has un@@ si@@ ghtly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting from image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to add a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ plug ; only shows files in formats that know . this is done by file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 200 raw data formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that were supported by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; but is not a movie editor , and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . &quot;

&quot; if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; edited . your description follows here .
&quot; use a single dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applic@@ ation@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparative mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
vertically divide without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
divide vertically . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . previ@@ ew@@ ing in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab displays an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallet files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and finally used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the palette knife . here , too , the color name can be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Ad@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the color button , the color is inserted from the color chart on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ writing . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character if another color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . until now , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs which include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are based on the program author &apos;s view &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ litho@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ litho@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; graph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ litho@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the options of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ ene in &amp; posters ; re @-@ calcul@@ ates the graph and represents in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a Po@@ graph ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to display more than this node )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ s , requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the screen@@ shot below : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will be done . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings &quot; &quot; Gra@@ ph &quot; &quot; ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , and eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ viewer ; -@@ instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it afterwards with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the sections of the graph will fit on this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph divided on several pages , without head@@ line and with another font &quot;
&quot; the Save Download page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or leave the program every time . &quot;
opening gives the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time you are asked .
the session management page gives you the option to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or determine the default behavior at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ er@@ ted graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces a boun@@ ce spring model for ung@@ er@@ ted graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ gal Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and contains a multi @-@ wire trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm al@@ ig@@ ns the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then run by a shell . the command should be able to accept the graph file as parameters , and pass the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ er@@ ted graph@@ s ) . &quot;

read the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and save new images .
&quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at the moment , two sources can be used : &quot;
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scanning button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to fix options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore produces very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
screen shots can be created after you have selected the Import - &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work place . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read in the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other working surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen shot has been made , the dialog appears options of the target image with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are led by the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . to upload , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently supports no other authori@@ z@@ ations . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button Add photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button the up@@ loading of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during high loading .
&quot; with the options open , friends and fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Cau@@ tion : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I mapping module for geographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with time zone . put your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have tracking data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . choose the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Add it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map may be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; the thumb@@ nail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color formations is taking place . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Cau@@ tion : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please see exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into an MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file to MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . afterwards , you can launch the module via Extras m@@ peg slide . &quot;
images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the content of the list or the content of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your needs , you can now go to the movie with the button code . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go for a cup of coffee quickly or in all rest and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings on the right bottom . &quot;
&quot; the Print Ass@@ ist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats of JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera operator . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w !
first select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently , or later use it otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a file format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all the images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image , for this purpose four types of image change are provided : &quot;
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; pre @-@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images using your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent beforehand .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will appear on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to add to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button to remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google mail service , you must first install the G@@ Mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are merged into a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in image file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced slide show , a window with questions like you would like to show your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions via Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option displays the file name of the images displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop allows the presentation to be displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select to indicate that the images are displayed in a random order . so it won &apos;t be the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect at each transition between the images .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Cau@@ tion : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you look at your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course to view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select another person , only the images on which both people are visible are displayed . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of their name . they can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however for each person , you can save your own preview image , which is of course also valid for places , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can , for example , display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to specify which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the image preview window ( in closer description ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the search in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for defining the image properties . you can view this dialog once more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the Lab@@ eling or Description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date may either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen photos and the introduction videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry for the first time ; then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the preview preview from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview button ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of time bar by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will see only pictures of this period in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , all images of a party are displayed . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not download images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so , it can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time , and if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; the best way to select a base folder for all of your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a file supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet found in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them to the destination folder . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three based on basic folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be specified in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to share your pictures with these . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file only a link to images is located . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you can have all the images together , and that this file can be shared independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file looks for the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file with HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view through the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
&quot; if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; photo@@ album copy &amp; photo@@ album automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File File ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ er the category Person@@ s of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories of the file to be imported will be imported and what categories it is in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry Settings photo@@ album ; set up ... you can access a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained .
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can view by pressing the F1 key and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the Options section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
in the left panel you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . you can find more information about this on the website of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules using the demo database before using them on your own pictures . don &apos;t tell you I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules use together with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications don &apos;t support their pictures in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview right now . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do so , so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and a tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window that you can browse through your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to display any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures , Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view of three lists with a text box , you can specify people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by moving the names used up , find the people faster and classi@@ fy them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and note these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item to use multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S. and San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a hyper@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Not@@ ation dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the paste which form the upper edge of the frame , and you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which , among other things , allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures in case you have not set a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , and try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press the Edit selection menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can have saved the images anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper edge is cut , are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nail images are present for the images 5 @-@ 9 , so you can view the preview of these images . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and then copy them back . so if you want to avoid using the respective CD , please buy a larger disk to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu you can find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible and click Lat@@ est view in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and select the menu entry All except current view . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in case of case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to forbi@@ d those who use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can spend all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to manage and describe hours for hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , you have a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have in the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box is located on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag it with your mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the p@@ ush@@ button picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus keys . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can pull in the image and zoom out . you can zoom in with the mouse . the minus button zo@@ oms into the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the key button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the Script functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment , you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to include this name . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you can view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in the picture you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , these are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you are editing , printing or whatever you choose , you can simply use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particular features can be displayed in preview view . if you can display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply clicking the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you allow you &amp; photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
&quot; the old one is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to turn off the painting mode from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; to work , you need to control the application of program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can rec@@ tify the input errors and click Apply to Apply or disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
&quot; the screen shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot;
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it at any time . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a given view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to assign multiple views over each other , you can move the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map button at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginning water to the desktop or click the small pointing arrow pointing left in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . &quot;
you can save the current window view with view window order ... Save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 actually . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the rendering icon The symbol rendering in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu entry view scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; render mode comp@@ lies with entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in View R@@ ender modes , the following dialog will open : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the size of the map , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel in the display . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general images with this property look better .
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; the second method is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adap@@ tively @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel depends on calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 incre@@ ments is calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is split into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection comp@@ uted . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . then a pixel is transparent when the corresponding rays hit no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; unexpectedly finished , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import scene , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on Help in the Property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; die &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User &apos;s documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle in the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; advanced Proj@@ ections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the wall , a wall is framed behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . &quot;
the standard window arrangement sel@@ ector : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and select selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with flash@@ cards you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less , you can see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this instruction , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera shows the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points that you can change the target of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button Application or the En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might insert a header ( insert End@@ eric Body Qu@@ ader ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; indeed offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the paste button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , though at the moment only as a limited end@@ ental plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can open the item for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose in the moment something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the thumb@@ nail preview you see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you need to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should be able to do this step by doing so , as you should have understood the basic principles of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to apply the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would float above the ground , since you have shifted the floor by one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the surface looks like a matt black material . put in the next step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as in the bottom , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on Sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
&quot; change the values as in the screen@@ shots below , and click Apply or press En@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the brightness @-@ effect and reflection effects already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you watch the scene . without a light source you will also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that needs to be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have saved the model already , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last un@@ revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing backwards .
&quot; stores the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or re@@ write an existing layout . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . with this option , you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modes ; -@@ commands or add new ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modes ; -@@ commands . &quot;
a dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in your own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can choose whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all pictures should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Start - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed that can display the program as well .
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; set the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nail images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is open .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; edited ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&quot; show photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos , and perform correc@@ tions and changes . &quot;
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute his part to , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; show a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . &quot;
&quot; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ cases , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ cases ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ cases ; . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them , clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you are supposed to indicate , in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ cases ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . the same page bar can be found in image editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer power than images to scan and save .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer power than images to scan and save . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before saving .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information you need on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when previ@@ ew@@ ing a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the name of the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be displayed before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; to save images . open dialog to save each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix , which is recorded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; to quit .

&quot; below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , and specify the key short@@ cuts to set . &quot;
you can possibly set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short@@ cuts work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break might look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok still has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use k@@ Edit to let the user know why a script doesn &apos;t run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates directory , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok implements the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece might be asked ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
to add an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove an entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; quit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the command amar@@ ok@@ script . that &apos;s why you should name your script packages right away .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . perhaps you will find only a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if you still have a hard decision , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that you can choose how to listen to your music . &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you shouldn &apos;t have trouble comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile @-@ time point using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty setting up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; to display the player window , the player window will additionally turn the playlist to the playlist . if the option is off , only the Play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok will be stored . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while moving . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible during play , it causes the playlist to be hung up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the unit to the context browser , automatically changes the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray displayed section to use . you can choose fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice user defined color scheme , you yourself have the source of choice and can define your own color scheme . for this purpose , use the color selection for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , the play automatically continues with the piece , with which it has been stopped at the last end . &quot;
&quot; setting up the O@@ SD on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be customized to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to determine which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment should be the O@@ SD .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers also activate other settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the check boxes as well as their sub@@ folders are searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( for example , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection , and the automatically added play@@ lists will later appear in the playlist browser . &quot;
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected a further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : if the computer is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if needed .
&quot; enter your user name and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send the played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to do e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to make k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the captured file causing the crash .
&quot; most of the time , this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens when you crash ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GA &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Symb@@ ols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are easily forgotten . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting will show its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok will use the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
most of the installation problems are resolved easily by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
bow z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear only one error if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only an empty playlist .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to rate pieces , the score must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show . you can also use the short commands for Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press release on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from playlist from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist using the mouse and drop it down there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar , next to the Add button , you can save play@@ lists . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably , the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : what media types does G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included ( due to pat@@ ent@@ less reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different link ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x issues problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge The Sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either you do not use the arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster art co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . run the registry register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then manage all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the following @-@ config / g@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the following register . &quot;
&quot; if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run this command with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed by the gentle sounds of music that you have stopped going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running title if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the performer and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence to the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click on the button of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click audio CD in the menu . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , you take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can add the review for a piece by clicking on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then , you can change the evaluation of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata . &quot;
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan that cannot be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can easily find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .

Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio @-@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install a distribution that is installing the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . &quot;
I get the error of G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix that ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check in the sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being cared for further . you may naturally like to take this problem into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be very easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or do not like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will be a help . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very easy . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes you search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist &apos;s playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , you will find several ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have several ways to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed , which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions .
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window there is a scroll bar displaying the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , playing time , bit rate and sampling rate of the current piece . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the scroll bar . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window . &quot;
under the scroll bar you can find the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used for setting equ@@ ali@@ zers .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player , but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side of the playlist . in the navigation field , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right @-@ hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece to each different aspect . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;ve already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information shown here is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras Statisti@@ cs ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to recre@@ ate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have any name , but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
&quot; among the received pieces , the favourite pieces of this artist are located . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter . &quot;
you can choose which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and select one of the ways to add the play or album to the playlist .
&quot; this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , you can download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database .
the search button search opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - only group the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces are arranged according to the performer and a further division according to the respective album is performed . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various performers . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Artist / year - album - Sor@@ ted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing album - All records of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically , and the performer is ignored . &quot;
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first displayed by genre and among them by performer .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works as well as the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing as you like . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ compile your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box , with which help you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours to a year . in addition , you can also select your total collection , which allows the filter to be switched on practically . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ aks up the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will get the same effect .
&quot; set the pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue , which will then be played next . &quot;
save as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the Media Player queu@@ es . for more details , see the Media Player browser section . &quot;
&quot; burn all the pieces of this performer / burn CD - In this way the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned as either a data or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - open the dialog for piece information , and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various performers . &quot;
&quot; add composition marking - Change a record marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under various interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser includes the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , find the pieces on your iPod by performer , sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will finish the pieces to your iPod . when the commit is finished , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar is a search area that allows you to search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all files in the file list are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , you can find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input button , you can go to music in the file musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be tricky by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert saved files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply typing the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter , for example , two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all items found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . by doing so , you search for entries that Mike Old@@ field is looking for , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the entries then get a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the right . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration via this menu .
&quot; there are many other buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ ditions and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and clicking on tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed simply by clicking twice in the respective display area with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting the cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover management . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you still have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these are later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , and add more random pieces while playing . &quot;
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly called Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double @-@ click on the play@@ lists you want , drag them into the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then select loading . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists received will start with an empty playlist , and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New button will empty the current playlist and add new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; here , enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed with regard to the setting played . &quot;
&quot; pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to play@@ lists after each piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right @-@ hand side are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you want to cross several play@@ lists , you will be able to add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . after installing the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then uninstall it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the letter writing scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . to follow the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ encoding MP3 , you will get a po@@ orer quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process . &quot;
this Quick Start Guide will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .

&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and you can also get feedback on community help from the forums and learn about news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder@@ - and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces will play differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
&quot; save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose file and file name for the project file . &quot;
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
&quot; if a project is changed and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and modifications . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , what should happen , just as if you would have called for each project file closing . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you called file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the dialog . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view in the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
&quot; this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only blocks the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium , even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you may later burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the converting / copying a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not supported yet , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely delete the content . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously worn DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used single @-@ sided . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings , and even ways to change size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and blocking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the table of contents allows the selection and drag of files to the project view . the table of contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . with this , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs may be set . to do this , system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; to use functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions which have common &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video Cloud Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String path ) void qui@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void retri@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
&quot; this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read out and saved in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ der that supports these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they are installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ enh@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to circum@@ vent any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to circum@@ vent the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid buying a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting only once ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this ( hopefully ) will lead to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , which will often stum@@ ble over you in the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is manually captured . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB enquiry of the CD data starts according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the coding settings tab in the setup directory - encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as logs , pi@@ ping ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame still comes with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - early 2009 - these devices mostly support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters must be added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it must be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from making use of the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more about it in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the right distribution first if this has not yet happened .
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine because it is considered non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , something that is supposed to be done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each release &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the true device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card General Settings . there &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only to ask for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information is missing for creating keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD ;
&quot; the second selection field is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag definitions , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name will be changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database first . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org side and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are bo@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
simply take over the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number at the same time : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , disc@@ ard : cross this to the CD ; to be ej@@ ected at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files are created in a private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; just enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs on average . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD , which runs on the hard disk , is described and set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built since we are comfortable and want to pick up the CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each release &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use one &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a CD ; with successful data retri@@ eved from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of extrac@@ ting them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
do not try the &amp; CD ; find this example . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD must be pushed into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered into &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the comment field of the album can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only begin with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words are with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the sten@@ c@@ tive CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . simply click on the line sh@@ uts down the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All items on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection read out of the reading process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; click on tab orders to switch to the job window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . do you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . for performance @-@ weak machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third job is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is true for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different settings of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any indication as it should go on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program start ) , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? if you are reading this , you probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; may it do . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely , if you have succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke Player of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , it also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the tool@@ bar , select the item Play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( for several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essively . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the slider . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and others both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song uses , so that you do not have to manually adjust the entry . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the collection menu under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and specify the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by click on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the only one in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection takes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you exit the application , this collection is not saved . keep in mind when you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu row order of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the next song , select the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song , select the button Pre@@ vious piece , the entry Pre@@ vious item from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transm@@ its general @-@ MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
this section describes how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun@@ shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , with which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; key maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel . look , for example , the provided keyword maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following sample : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name Name for this channel will be used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always Patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM provides a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , and so on . thus , the same MIDI file can result in very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; OK , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn on automatic adding to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , that encourages me to program on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m studying programming , MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a mail or a MIDI file , please contact me , because I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and no one gets money for it . therefore , I would like to emphasize that I only need more programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E maps .
&quot; my thanks also apply to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians in the network that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups in order to get an additional hierarchy level . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Players / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select play@@ lists from the menu and either select Edit mode or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same to the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; animation when starting and moving can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; animation while starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the view of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; / / ; / / ; / / ; / / ; / / ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
&quot; there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example how to play a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ ME players ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in setup dialog file Zu@@ orders of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is used in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ ME ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a specific Mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( which requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device to be used and the TV channels must be used . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be ports where one is selected ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the development of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ resource . if they are enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there any hints about how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as user root after the device has been inserted . it is essential to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts up slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably relies on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux / Linux distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution and installation CD should be used ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you wish to compile &amp; Ki@@ le , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn about its possibilities the manual of Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate ; start .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to operate , a lay@@ man can also use a La@@ y ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the last name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while here is only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; -@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers a number of options for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , writing ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; more amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
coding : this is used to set the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best should U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in creating German texts . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , a simple problem search is possible . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le , automatically an empty line ( for typing the text ) and the corresponding line to the commands of the command are created ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the Settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into a few elements , and lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ merged element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI ; file is created , boun@@ ce &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the current output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the button search , the elements of the DVI ; file are drawn with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the exact opposite is required . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding part in the DVI ; viewer was inj@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used at work with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings . &quot;
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file on the &quot; &quot; multiple &quot; &quot; parts , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes or links . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or other element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¨ e is used for the definition of the font . it is possible to specify the fon@@ ts for the main text , the joint no@@ des , etc . the following fon@@ ts are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and maintaining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ tion Building or the Fast@@ ening button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for storage automatically .
&quot; if the compilation of the document fails , errors should be searched for errors . if you use quick construction , you should automatically start logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few sc@@ anners should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge , and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of the fon@@ ts within the surrounding area &quot; &quot; Gi@@ ant &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the changes are only supervised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , li@@ pos@@ u@@ ction , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is useful for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ tem@@ per { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; sign language is presented , follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . at least a quote , a few passages in the fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be converted back to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file is created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion to desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the default search enables direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this simply set up Modern under Settings box ... tools building will be selected .
&quot; to execute the preliminary search , the mouse @-@ po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on preview button . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewers will then take place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; as text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if an error occurs when using fast construction of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file tells the source code in the source code . in the editor , the pop @-@ up Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¶ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , click on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the correct line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the relevant button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document may be written either from scratch or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , please refer to the section . &quot;
&quot; common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings General . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { It@@ em } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard features . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . in an easy way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual of Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use and its syntax .
double @-@ click with the C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that the \ \ par \ \ big@@ a \ \ big@@ a \ \ big@@ a \ \ \ big@@ a \ \ \ big@@ a \ \ \ big@@ a \ \ \ big@@ a \ \ \ big@@ a \ \ \ big@@ a .
&quot; when drawing the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
many assistants can add additional jumping tok@@ ens . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ ue to the snap @-@ mark or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes allows the jump to the next or last jump mark . this also highlights this spring@@ board so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent options , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; add special commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ itative thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the ab@@ uses are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command is also known as &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back button ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) in the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , the key can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ ste ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with its own commands for a faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to the Edit Select sub@@ section .
&quot; it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the command to open the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview of the surrounding environment can quickly be lost . this command completes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ sor opening bracket . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the group will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted @-@ welded groups @-@ brackets you can quickly lose the overview over it . this command completes the last formed group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple reference marks are used as a model . for the purpose @-@ related implementation , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple reference marks . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two close @-@ up signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double reference mark can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use foreign settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , as well as German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when shifting Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a tables environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already providing a good source code execution , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for specific commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , these include three different modes . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new environment with the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the back button is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list will be removed . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also snap @-@ marks can be added so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible using the snap @-@ mark N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jump mark and the desired parameters can be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as qui@@ vers of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for completion of environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ begin will have to be entered and a large list of environment commands will result . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for complete destruction of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ charge mode over the menu @-@ to @-@ date environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment automatically freezes and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by clicking the input key can be stopped . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list@@ ings environment , even a first \ \ item command is included . &quot;
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ list of Complete Def@@ ensive mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box ... for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word def@@ aults to the menu of the full @-@ time reduction or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
large wi@@ pers are not helpful for automatic completion . however it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in a document .
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ fully shut down . here , the threshold value for the ad placement can also be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / box / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche home folder . it stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all the tools are group@@ ed in groups in the Cre@@ ating , Imple@@ menting and Cre@@ ating View menu . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used the key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted by Alt ; 4 ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after the compile . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
&quot; a new project about the project New Project .... here , the following information for the project will be asked : &quot;
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet fully developed , and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids for supporting users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ til ; are shipped with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the search for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; boxes ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the available documents and for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or clicking the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor available on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use with regard to the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; load , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this allows the plugin system to benefit instantly and do not need to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or part , we begin with the menu plug @-@ in . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage and add new plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often work on a project involves several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members , and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves to uniquely identify .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and selecting the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears bold as they are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is certain . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something is done in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or the sending of a message when a file is added to CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such guides will be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
note : you can either select the comment name from the Editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; comments can be sent a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax is @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member , the appropriate range or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces for par@@ enth@@ eses and notes are invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends across some pages that are treated succ@@ essively .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion , it can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; tags : large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in the tag XML files . &quot;
&quot; size / wer@@ case of attributes : large / wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close optional tags : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and finish tag automatically : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
&quot; standard character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting will be sto@@ cked from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default for the next startup is useful when the user interface has come across by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dra@@ gging views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used to control al@@ erts by means of hooks of no more queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree can be adjusted automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it &apos;s not in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load the component in the read @-@ only mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ k@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plugin : if this is checked , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting is completely new . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , is made , or it spl@@ its the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case you do not have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen &apos;s session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the listening according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger display view .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is given , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is set . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include files .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , and if possible in functions and include , it will be bug @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next one , as if there is the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; its simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two types of files , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic past@@ es of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ ged XML files , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows . the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a typing error . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing as a folder . they only contain the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ ged files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ ged XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type above itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . by using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; this element can only be used once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a only element type element . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the source code used for filling out the attributes in tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the data source .
&quot; it requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface name and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that summari@@ zes the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ ged XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy @-@ cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; this should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tool is dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; select windows and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the check takes place only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ ged file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ ged file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for it , at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D mach@@ ined DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the user defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered into the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts local scrip@@ ting folders : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . in the input field input you can determine what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; in accordance with the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them , enable &quot; Edit Tag , &quot; if available so that you can enter the action when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is it an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; use 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start date , I decided to create a starter button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered to be released , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will be entered ; -@@ day in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the application button and continue with other tags , if there are some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared with several separ@@ ators for a better overview . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user , it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like best . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone else has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first you have to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first of all , we &apos;ll give you the second treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = day 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = day 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = day 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element item = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = table of content , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the contents section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to design context @-@ sensitive help . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of comm@@ a @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations , there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make a full post , we recommend signing the resources for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of resources , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , upload tool bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source file of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in the tag XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . choose the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; doc@@ type definition line : the string , which is in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / W3@@ C / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first acqua@@ int themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . from tool@@ bars to promotions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this allows the administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements are a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS to tool@@ bars with special promotions , especially for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ bedding the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card holders with info and tool@@ bars . please check in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all the file riders , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ clicking in the Editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / past@@ ing / paste ) , the word under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the editor &apos;s tool@@ bars are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new features and associated user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows administrators to manage files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done using the contex@@ tual menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . it is open to you all possibilities . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . global templates are always available ; local templates are only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spin @-@ off in Global , Local , and Project works here too . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking an element , a list of commands opens with respect to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows all the errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
the Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the way to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what has already developed anyone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itting actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has quickly been expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , type , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ett Sequ@@ itur ( @ k@@ de@@ .org ) and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , and the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converting from the cli@@ p@@ board to the cli@@ p@@ board , converts special characters to &amp; HTML ; en@@ rol@@ ment , so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
starting and switching the problem porter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the visual field . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
loading one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this is globally and a write permission is not available in the global K@@ DE folder , the shop will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ tion by tool bar refuses if this day in this place contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . clicking on an activated plu@@ gins will disable it . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line @-@ line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using external use ti@@ dy .
&quot; inst@@ ant@@ aneous switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting a single entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you will find details . &quot;
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and modify the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the context of the mouse @-@ pointing device , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ a. .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . on server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be linked . if a project is started anew , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the check , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or modified using the Shift ; F@@ 7 button .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; upload profiles ( see in ) to upload profiles ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the server &apos;s content for each profile by cont@@ acting your own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at this time . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the Open Project Open will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button : &quot;
the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is displayed to prevent removing . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programs . this option is useful when frequently up@@ loading files is needed and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password stored on the disk -@@ option is not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slave . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can &apos;t be easily read but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply swap the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project tool@@ bar in the project or project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; preferably stack@@ able via the tool@@ bar menu . use and adding differ . adding tool bars is treated below in the addition of tool bars . &quot;
&quot; tool bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be removed , the tool@@ bar can be moved , or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified where actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and setting actions .. set .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; basically uses templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . for more information on the templates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . see in for more information on templates tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document should always be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole web sites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File Add a template as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right and choose a site template in the file tree or in the project files , and secure a name for the template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically linked with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / js and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template folder with the right mouse button to click on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a selection box with the three types described previously ; files , text or templates . this selection is displayed as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; if a regular folder is set , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders , copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor , which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; in a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the absence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization gap between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the web page , it is possible to select the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows changing the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted by button or distance key . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way via tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other drop anchor tag . &quot;
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Wi@@ zard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style template can be pursued .
&quot; around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successfully , except &amp; k@@ de ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time fixed the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function was transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; 3 @-@ way merge operation is supported completely . this is useful when two persons work independently from one piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps when comparing and merging complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to verify code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anger if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 , Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o destination folder &quot;
&quot; open dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is done with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and merging of folders are initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the comparing / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drop text into a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . then a small help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , the color indicates which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is well visible in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages , where white marks are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary row from the text , is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line revers@@ al is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; modi@@ fying &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text by the automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons for the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary row in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group . &quot;
&quot; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l end . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , conflicts between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ paste ) . if enabled , you will automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ paste ) . however , be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ending of the source files , so you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered straight . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tabl@@ ature key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary . &quot;
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return mark &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes may appear in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison though they are different . during merging this option must be disabled . in default , this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is inj@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . for details , see Docum@@ entation to compare and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and an older version exists , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit and restart , to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
over the selection fields for coding a short note shows what the local coding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then ab@@ rup@@ tly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this command line command for line matching to convert input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now the \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processor command for line matching . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different from per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l are different for per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) is required per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; example :
&quot; the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and merging . further operations only change the data , which sees the line @-@ like algorithm al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ processor can see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may not accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without really performing it
&quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merging . to start merging , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will find a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that have been compared to then will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - clicking on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ clicking on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . for folders , age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after merging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option Select a new file instead of merge ( in@@ secure ) is checked , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; while merging , a file is processed after the other . you status column shows skill when merging is successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected as a full @-@ time analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( including all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you haven &apos;t specified a destination folder , C will be used as a destination in the Three folder merge mode , B will be chosen as the target and the sync will be A and / or B as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries : select directory merge / resume in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if invalid interaction actions exist through conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window with the options appears , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you first want to see what would happen without the real change , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select start / resume directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you may choose to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be displayed again . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there may be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there may be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a publisher attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a prec@@ ursor marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not contain possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security . please use caution with caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this may be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; enable synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging will be selected in such a way that both folders are subsequently stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it is assumed that the other file was not altered too . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merging of individual files , not just merging entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view will be visible to merge individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can turn the window divi@@ der into the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a menu entry in the menu . you can also directly merge a single file without having to start the folder merge . to do so , use the Rec@@ ent File merge function and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
&quot; a path can be relative und@@ . or .. contain . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters need to be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , white character &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # contains the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or a folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( ft@@ p : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently the difference observer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . first , K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . then , the program patch will start to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the comparison of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now called Comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by st@@ acking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or go this way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor noted for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too large so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger volumes of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is sudden ; no sr@@ c has been left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ L@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of this . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replace the current marker .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version of the program , you will need to re @-@ read the Update folder after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries showing differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . various characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only displays the two entries P@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , window within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is enabled , the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , all virtual work@@ spaces appear horizont@@ ally and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection of switch settings ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you will need to login as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
&quot; if you like &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag , shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window below . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( sel@@ ector mode ) or the environment of the mouse pointing at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse po@@ inter option . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and post@@ p@@ one the content of the magni@@ fier window . this is also possible with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the refresh of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; Automati@@ cally uses your set short @-@ commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fication and size reduction , etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;

&quot; em@@ ulated a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter persi@@ sts for a while in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and the mouse click em@@ ulate . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic means of aid : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and displays a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button . in this way , you can execute the drawing with pressed mouse button . this intelligent shifting requires a little bit of exercise , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Flight is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button shut@@ down , the mouse button will wait until the mouse button is pressed . &quot;
&quot; a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . this move will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there &apos;s a slide control sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this feature is selected , is started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available on &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , to find out how to start a program there automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand@@ by after the last press is pressed . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should be switched off first . if you then have used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not present a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the wheels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to manually select text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shift if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows needs to be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click is only available when the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker .
&quot; this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , and the operation of the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; c@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; c@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases that are to be spoken once again from a list with the conversation history . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text editor . you can often choose text passages from the text passages , without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the vocabulary for the word supplement . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can reconci@@ le the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically a input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have c@@ mouth ; set correctly , you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word supplement and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , set the character encoding with the text to be passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . choose the check box , if the text should be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output is available and that is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text directory or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and inserted in the memory cache . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second sel@@ ector box , close the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text directory will be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text directory will not be saved . if you want to save it before saving , then &amp; c@@ mouth ; ask if the text directory should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word supplement page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word supplement . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for the word supplement . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; select the desired language for this source ; &amp; c@@ mouth ; then read the &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ de &quot; &quot; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries to merge , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated button . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting them in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the feed storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the feed storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the tra@@ iling memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with clu@@ es about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a movable bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar above the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably you haven &apos;t entered the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings c@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card reader voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ sh are supported . the license allows free use of the festival without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows free use of Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without any restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the Free@@ T@@ TS application . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
/ usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; - further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; c@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to make use of &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak text can be issued by the computer . it stores a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always re@@ generate . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on the computer .
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows every application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer willing to provide their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
&quot; the speech output takes place via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ less mailing list . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ reserved . you can also find the developers in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ zoo ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you need to install and set the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the card card is displayed in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer drives for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the Cart@@ ridge tab Spo@@ kes@@ person in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card is displayed . it also appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not give a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to move the speaker down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
&quot; choose a type of tuning , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card card or@@ ator . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text messages . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card reader General to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to activate the kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , will shut K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; the buttons in this series allow you to start , break , pause and resume text messages . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for one job . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check voice @-@ over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text to read and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to select the text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check the text to read and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; note is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name is common . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed as pres@@ upp@@ osed in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filters are processed before being sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
&quot; a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; c@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who is just entering the room . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you send from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text assignments . text messages are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order cards are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this issue is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ arms , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be more types of filters .
&quot; string players replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre @-@ defined drawing @-@ tags filters , which allow the replacing of chat emotions such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files containing &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ml .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program , which has the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card holder , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about this . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules fail to apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text application , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs are displayed . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ reset .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , will app@@ end the entries from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application id running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter it . &quot;
&quot; the string release filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with words , the character sequence filter uses regular expressions in \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such implement@@ ations . it can only be applied to well formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; with the spokes@@ woman selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card holder , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the features of the speaker set up on the card card . with the spokesperson selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; is a value entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click it with one click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected that meets the desired requirements . click on the right button to show the voice selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your spre@@ ader settings or delete all settings .
the fan selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ese filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and expand for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; program . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for purchases or downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , you will be able to compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is working properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed so that the installation of speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can reverse , repeat or cancel articles or paragra@@ phs . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how to t@@ act ; select a speaker , look in . &quot;
&quot; for example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active is shown below . for example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active is shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text handed to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is made automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these slide controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the chosen voice will not let you choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you select this check box , these voices are loaded already at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after starting , only the symbol is kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited sentence . the or@@ ator ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or return in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only lists of text messages , warnings and messages are not displayed here . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please click here . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ,@@ 0 ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the issue of Screen Reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who is just entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text application is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text application is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , warnings and the editions of Screen Re@@ aders if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card notification appears . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this option is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played will not be read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following options :
&quot; if you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that appears as the top entry in the list on the card card . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the messages to a file . the loaded events will be merged with events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , sex voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the speed or pitch settings are not set to 100 % in the festival configuration dialog , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds cut text into individual sentences . this allows you to start or stop orders faster with pre @-@ reading , as only the first set does not have to start or stop , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a by@@ te detection filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , but beginners will get rid of it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn is to select the speaker selection by trying out . turn off the voice selection and enter text to read . check the voice selection again , change some properties and check how the choice of speaker changes . to do so , you have to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then can start faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then pause or cancel text assignments on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the regular pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
set limit identi@@ fier filters compare text with a regular expression for by@@ laws and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the by@@ laws ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before the filter ) . note that the standard set limit identi@@ fier retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ew ) , al@@ erts , messages or the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the regular pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application on the card reader selection , and the card card is displayed when &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card holder ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select and kt@@ ts ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is most likely to match the original features . &quot;
&quot; to enter the desired speaker properties , click on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; select the characteristics of the speaker you want here . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker button and then use speaker , which is most likely to follow the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the final text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get any trace@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and kt@@ ts ; it has been terminated . you may need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x . if the problem is not solved , you might need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA occur which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ ps / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developer . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ izer modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed on the card adapter . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ formation filter , and set up the subscri@@ ber speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read pages with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file th@@ rows to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ml to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added my own character @-@ release filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not go back or go back . on the cart@@ on tur@@ ner orders are indicated , the order is only from one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for this character instead . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflict in audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &quot;
&quot; with July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ x audio program is used for general setting of speech speed , but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look for festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ kal@@ ische Analyse and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create Di@@ phone from German lyrics . more information can be found here .
&quot; with this procedure additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the Fol@@ der Festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

&quot; epic is a free speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this voice synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map file or@@ ator , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS voice synthes@@ izer . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer that has been written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume or speech speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows managing the network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allow for the user a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are shown at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module Network Set@@ ting ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ; Start . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be functioning and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and setting the network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed to install &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the network settings are selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , it tries to automatically detect the system used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by checking the non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries , the setting can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pres@@ et . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gra@@ yed gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you will be prompted by clicking the button System Administration Mode on the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the dialog Device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are simultaneously done with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the manual selection manual , you can set up the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch @-@ on of an off @-@ off network device by selecting from the list and activating interface ...
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating interface .... &quot;
&quot; establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the host name resolution part of the Rei@@ ter nam@@ ing solution allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added or removed or changed . DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down in priority .
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add New Name Server dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit button . &quot;
&quot; name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , shut @-@ off networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of Nam@@ ed hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the review is to replace version 4 in the future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the familiar calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , de button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a particular well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog acquaint@@ ance machine will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second one will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
this section may not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently operated using TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to run through in the near future . this description is now focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is attributable to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator can use D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a domain reserved specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateway . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the host computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part are the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content found there in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; re @-@ sp@@ rou@@ t the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; dat ; do not know the pr@@ elo@@ ader on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if the index is not found , you will be asked if the index should be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; when everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through out of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; to recognize by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , it must be format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat , continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the check@@ out is started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ connect , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the record for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
&quot; right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select Rest@@ ore in the File menu .... &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; once you have confirmed the restore settings , the restart will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the Band@@ inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all files listed under backup files , only the files located in that file are stored in the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be listed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to as@@ certain the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can do the following settings :
the full path to the device file for tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ trac@@ table version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is involved , the command will be loaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; dated ; susp@@ end the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , when releasing &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy spre@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar @-@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system logs the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quickly access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions , including : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the screen@@ shot below , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup tried &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open . if you do not see it , and it opens up instead of a small message window , you usually don &apos;t have permission to read under Linux . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the fil@@ ter@@ bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string . in the default setting , the drop @-@ down list will only be displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . minutes rows of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than minutes rows of level indication . the color display of minutes rows can be switched off setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can display the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the &quot; &quot; Add new lines &quot; &quot; option from the main window context menu to display all new line @-@ up lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ blo@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the System V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling program starts when the system starts up in the &amp; Linux ; world . and because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , which has to do with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places and starts the first one that it finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning area you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably realize that the default running level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have done something together , then you can fix it by restart the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter the l -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it contains a K , the script is called up with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; run a server running level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to fail tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running level to start ( or stop ) it on this level .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level , removing it somewhere else . this will only be removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to recover items thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous . &quot;
to move an entry into another Run@@ level move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
&quot; to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by clicking the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ charging . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you have to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not comply with any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are located in the correct directory ) . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that it can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
