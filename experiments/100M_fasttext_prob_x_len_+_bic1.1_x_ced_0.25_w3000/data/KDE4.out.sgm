<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed due to the need to unify the camera image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required for use of metadata.</seg>

<seg id="381">"their only other picture editions are via email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why do you need to use a different colour space and think about color blending?"</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, compare, Automatic offset and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the levels of leustus over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point are as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same number of pixels achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either works miracles in an image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Extend contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a rejib of all values in-between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitised; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited since it is working on a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be viewed in size. on the left side you can see both the original image as well as preview of the target image. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram is very helpful there, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow Alignment lets you improve or digest the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Load make exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it in a text file and load it back later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the preset button sets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and stands only for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as the editing of raw pictures. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under color grading correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use them for more photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for tone correction you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digiplug; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was called Solarisation, also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when using a partly developed pressure of a short flash light and later reversed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisationeffect. the original image is the (1) and editing the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a movie of choice for nature photographers. Velvias's strong saturated colors are also a few photographers especially those who have hardly finished landscapes too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon light. with large images, the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can browse the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"for the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchthickness / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the scope of the slider for the use purpose described here. more concrete the three slide below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slides are clicked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the easiest way to learn to operate is to shift the controls, and to make sure the picture changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right-hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: this selection box can be set whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the linear histogram is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gammasts."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color tweets can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to interactively change the output values as in input parameters. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create an outstretched image as background while something else is in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and recharged later. for this purpose, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the entries of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that changes from the module:</seg>

<seg id="479">& edited; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates grainy images especially in dark areas."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners employ a sharpening filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this can be done with the menu entry Correcting sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will focus the tool. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image slightly softly is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to sharpen and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of grate are generated near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius calculates how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference to apply for an edge of the filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharper and therefore plastic flaw in faces, celestial and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & edited; tool refocusing refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filters. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blurring mask. refocusing usually achieves better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing paint in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'folding. the Gauß' folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will continue to merge the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use these parameters if your blurring is palpable. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauze. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally Unsharp Masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking used a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear Filter. practical is the result of the FIR Viennese filter always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions smoothing and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should get details so that no sharpening should be subsequently subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. so set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle increment da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to leave it out."</seg>

<seg id="651">"golden centre: the golden centre is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden divisions in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more fluid lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you good results to your goal. compared to the third-party gel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles also derive from the above discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can make a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use gold triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographer. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options and vertices can be mirrored to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>

<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your images frequently, or later use it otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a file format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="919">"first, enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on photoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings."</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page."</seg>
<seg id="921">"last but not least, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, all images of a party are displayed. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why they are not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not download images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so, it can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time, and if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"the best way to select a base folder for all of your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a file supported by KDE, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files you created are not yet found in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them to the destination folder. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings described above have all three based on basic folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name will be specified in the output folder."</seg>

<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import other into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file only a link to images is located. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you can have all the images together, and that this file can be shared independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can either export a .kin file directly from the File... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kin file looks for the images in a twofold way. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file with HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view through the File Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">"if you want to copy manually to the .kim file, you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & photoalbum copy & photoalbum automatically to the .kim file; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">"since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File File... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import pictures are to be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personer the category Persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box, which categories of the file to be imported will be imported and what categories it is in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="960">"the applications that the modules use together with KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications don't support their pictures in albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum."</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 increments is calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is split into 4 sub-pixels, which are further pursued and checked for further division. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn on jitter, change & Povray; beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example to add the & CD; add titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters must be added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it must be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from making use of the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more about it in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the right distribution first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the selected WAV files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for pre-defined encoders. more information on encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; konsole)." lame "must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1588">"note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed."</seg>

<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gunshot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, with which each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas, etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"key maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel. look, for example, the provided keyword maps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following sample:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap with the name Name for this channel will be used. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always Patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM provides a keyboard that receives a pitch-bender event with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2208">"project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically linked with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / js and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>

<seg id="2215">"& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor, which can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; in a document containing & PHP, a small green symbol shows the absence of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works exactly like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor."</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL; editor and the source editor is configurable via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; -View can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"assuming you want to change the title of the web page, it is possible to select the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this can change the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2221">"meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines.

<seg id="2225">"the insertion of tags is done in the same way via toolbars, as in the source editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed any other drop anchor tag."</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more anger if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2294">"open dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is done with two files."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merging of folders are initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only drop text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. then a small help window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, the color indicates which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is well visible in the next section (merge)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages, where white marks are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the summary row from the text, is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line reversal is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>

<seg id="2334">"in auto-skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is injected."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignorere C / C + + comments."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"first, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alarms, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can still be more types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules fail to apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>

<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. minutes rows of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color than minutes rows of level indication. the color display of minutes rows can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can display the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the System V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling program starts when the system starts up in the & Linux; world. and because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls are rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, which has to do with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably realize that the default running level 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have done something together, then you can fix it by restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter the l -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it contains a K, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; run a server running level that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to fail trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running level to start (or stop) it on this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level, removing it somewhere else. this will only be removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to recover items thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by clicking the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
