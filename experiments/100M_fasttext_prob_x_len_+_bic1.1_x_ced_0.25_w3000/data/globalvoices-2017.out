&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinary .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American movie . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was , as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very warm letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican presidential elections was the highest number , who had ever reached a candidate nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people that I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that embra@@ ces people from all over the world , a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the world outlook was not consistent with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; my intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Klo@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump saw his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most white are voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , do they want to say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks different with contemp@@ t for those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( N.@@ B. : as much as &quot; mut@@ ing the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word game from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , but it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ er whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else would be possible anywhere in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the white America that promises and says : &quot; hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is at the helm again , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd shou@@ ted .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do Af@@ ro Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der .
&quot; could anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close link with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ mo@@ il you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays Capital - play on instruments made of recycled waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made of tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article by Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; that changed when Fa@@ vio had been shown something , which he had never seen before : a violin made from waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
&quot; those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like humans in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
the Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content together .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Li@@ berian waters before the other coast of Africa visited . &quot;
the East African countries were therefore upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ender of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Administration . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had expelled from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the s@@ nail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , actions happen nowadays in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships , when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark vessels that are fishing in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can , on the basis of this information , deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i lose each year due to illegal fishermen that penetrate East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions such as sailing under a false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ inary names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You must not run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to close now . &quot;
until now the closed front works .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
&quot; it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has tra@@ cked and found escape ships . &quot;
&quot; due to his co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious vessels more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down the illegal vessels that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland , therefore , helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed by the position of every single tracking ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meeting with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what to do - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to f@@ use without a license earlier and hardly had to face consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were found on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there have been six countries united in 2015 , so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty the goal of even more such initiatives and structures can be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph . in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also entered into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such a collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to spin : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; capturing the country &quot; &quot;

they considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ ans government rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by assembling on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva Y@@ as@@ part@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profit rate is among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum has been considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and close a new governance alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the elections of 2015 to support the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own statement . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear tubes , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic depic@@ ts the lap , which forms the extent of repression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of the signatures are fak@@ ed .
here is your ten@@ ure !
on the road !
&quot; others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to hide critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept family secrets for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I thought it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ e@@ officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison until 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power is a parent of his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; just hope that they won &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day , and I have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers Party . &quot;
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
all of this was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a couch lying on men . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
&quot; they seldom hold a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that someone can do so much harm to another person ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were brought to the eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were facing down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people mun@@ ched still on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I was seeing the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero found a man there and killed .
&quot; according to information from survivors of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the path on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that one has fought against an enemy that has been fought .

&quot; but if you go into a house and steal the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you , who ste@@ al@@ ds your cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with rage , beat me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you individually . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the trial , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but nevertheless he brought home clothes . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me under the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to tell .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did not these people also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course something remains forever .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even participated in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations about all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for his sake .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants were killed during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ stat@@ er@@ ror@@ ism &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped in June 1976 with his pregnant woman and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , established in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located in order to build a memorial that is now being led by human rights organisations . &quot;

translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto in which one can pro@@ long its driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , witnessed a particularly mis@@ successful translation in the last month . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ ss@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; - was wrong@@ ly translated - perhaps even with vi@@ cious am@@ bush thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible drivers . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos that have been widely shared in social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , an inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appeared in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text , which they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely ap@@ ologi@@ ze that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents is quite a matter of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens generated 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the article published on Yahoo , the non @-@ known re@@ porter brought comments to the light that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So wrong , the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have a foreign workforce do not allow translations to be produced internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is rated as the best , becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the controversial and pu@@ zzling phrases that arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zzling prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery , acceptable , or at least harmless . but of large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; the city of Kyoto , hopefully , will use a rep@@ utable source for its translation in the future . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
other online stations also over@@ took photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as that were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was sn@@ apped and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Venezu@@ el@@ an providers have been banned again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been reluct@@ ant since 2014 when reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable television and informative national TV channels .
it is surprising that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fo later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers answer requests for certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers er@@ ron@@ eous or refuses the request by calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was broadcast on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who took the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was deta@@ ined . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to obtain an education &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers witness accounts of other Cri@@ adi@@ ta who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ turally , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride she spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her minor son or her minor daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , education and a roof over his head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ mean Az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally not silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family who has her daughter in the belief that she can complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; do something out of herself &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who receives the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an ste@@ wards , has a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed a lot of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra moved on a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest r@@ allies and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos became widespread in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lam@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean .
&quot; if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pointing out - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ mean
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street , or on the market to make money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours . &quot;
she had to divide the time in such a way that her still time to learn .
she got up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge &quot; , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was part of the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the master of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the official media reports of the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would again &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there . this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , belonging to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak to Guar@@ an@@ í home again at home . &quot;
&quot; their Lord fear@@ ing that they would lose the education they had made possible , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she received from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is mo@@ bbing and the ch@@ ic@@ anes that cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society endor@@ ses Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to us .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the interior , who wants to work , &quot; was written . &quot;
then the placement of the display switched on again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ ani were ens@@ la@@ ved and the native population gave them tribute . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be established , which is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their correct names and identity numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; Any Application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities should account for the registration . it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and got a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techni@@ cian at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and to bring them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ised and ensured that no diver@@ gent nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliamentary group Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; threat@@ ens public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger le@@ op@@ ard family , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; The Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem is also dependent on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out pure pleasure . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the north @-@ east of Japan , documented the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture has been a major pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal towns disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , already because of that , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the paper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the suffer@@ ers themselves .
&quot; the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare homes were completed in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare homes were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , it is still endeav@@ our@@ ing to reloc@@ ate six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by shelter camps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s , &quot; &quot; Kaz@@ ak@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; more than 75 per cent of those who survived after disaster in shelter shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can have only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper declares : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey yiel@@ ded that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that there was still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma
&quot; in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into permanent plac@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated ones are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the World is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people from other countries meet , who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love for music has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being kno@@ cked down by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer took him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now have transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures , too , the face of the police officer was identified , which attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he hits Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs immediately rush to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is hospit@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a strike . &quot;
police gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , polic@@ emen were deployed in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the deputy , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from viol@@ ating demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped off road protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported on a broken glass window in order to create a photo of their titles illustr@@ atively .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than over the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
Cuba &apos;s For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane mills throughout Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after the fall , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory lost its facilities until only the skel@@ eton of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories , which are still grinding . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which have been in operation after a long period of time because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories to produce the sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound has to remain , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Nutrition Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich &apos;s sugar cane factory on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be maintained , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was official documents which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over@@ grown and the letters were more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , which he helped to build . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important counter@@ f@@ itter has been eradic@@ ated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that were generated in the congregations in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the folk group Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to protest , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other factories . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to find other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without prospects for the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ proof person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is going to reti@@ re at 65 years old , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop addresses the fact that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
&quot; for the most part , the cases have not been clari@@ fied . &quot;
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the theme of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation is .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people had not always mastered the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung at Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody is ever interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our cry .
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so they can grow , and also to advance our youth . &quot;
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and defender of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) from any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see themselves these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend now transforms them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic dishes decorated mobile phone bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon che@@ ating ? &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members pleasantly .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
for more bizarre plastic dishes you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 of the many &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . like the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the report on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , was completely pushing the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; learning to live with drug trade &quot; &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ cky que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how Fear Chang@@ ing Life &quot; &quot; tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have asked ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he was to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you stand for my father &apos;s insurance , but she doesn &apos;t pay it out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I &apos;ve been familiar with disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or acts of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ firm@@ ity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; so@@ aking . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed by threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals pres@@ sured money from their business month by the end , but also torn apart their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain passing never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as they do not know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked myself whether wines would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence @-@ drawn generation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , keep tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; they are , however , in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8,5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tortured the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages that he links include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how is the year after something emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ oped , including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people looking at the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch it .
but history does not end here .
&quot; over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ov@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dramatically reported atro@@ cities before which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one left behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a man on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated graphi@@ cally . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the image from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
one step further personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely affect the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a Blitz@@ krieg , published by the United Nations described those who could flee pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following published these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news site , fal@@ sely claiming that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an had said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations calling AF@@ P as their source , also fal@@ sely attributed to this statement , had not linked the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide coverage of false data
traces of this false dec@@ eption date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how much information you can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( status of May 3rd , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed wrong reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which side they had been published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the card in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; the countries in grey are examples , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also due to precip@@ itation examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

one side of the rum@@ ours was that the said photo shows Christians killed by Muslims .
&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only identifies the mis@@ information , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in northern @-@ kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , we have clearly seen no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faulty use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact check page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a federation of students of theology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
an inhabit@@ ant of the Old Town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in 2015 .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive usage of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos were ab@@ u@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the government of Myanmar published a correction of what it meant as &quot; inten@@ tional fin@@ ned news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this employment , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which was addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was admitted to 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to be included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , the Catholic close to An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was subsequently put into circulation in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ til@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is asleep ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted their communities to pay a greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was twe@@ aked for the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( English ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message supposedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos responded . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye refers to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and isolated , they have image files in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the mur@@ m@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of the Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who are un@@ inten@@ tional to take the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and are the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the restra@@ ining of images of a refusal is equal , to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot of debate about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used from context or completely mis@@ use . &quot;
&quot; however , every investigation of false attri@@ butions should also consider how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. inv@@ inci@@ ble ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ des ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Wa@@ it for your parents in recognition of how to make your effort in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ ha@@ k language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have war@@ med yourself in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
&quot; by severe ra@@ ins the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya came over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people were missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge cla@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle was also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a yesterday . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are made to transport emergency supplies to the residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and food @-@ nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) is asking people to share their location data with the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; Hoch@@ wasser@@ hilfe &quot; &quot; key , which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people into safety and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we sc@@ atter rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied out of an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , don &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has developed in their imagination . &quot;
they are disp@@ ar@@ ming me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , become de@@ pressed . &quot;
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone with that alone .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western notion , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the duk@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ car@@ ded the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to enter@@ tain them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it looks like the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it cle@@ ars the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ stem@@ med Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother introduced her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh , with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan re@@ invented the world sky@@ lines , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a sham@@ eless Muslim and an American ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims carry with them - &quot; &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who ri@@ ps a woman &apos;s scar@@ f . &quot;
&quot; or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;
the author 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
use approved .
I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter if I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

use approved .
&quot; belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters , how she won a competition of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of the Su@@ fi Holy One ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - over centuries - col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; empire , &quot; which founded a company called hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at play risk . &quot;
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time Grand@@ father of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy eng@@ ul@@ fs the US and the suspect is carrying a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion presents more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists of immig@@ rant officials , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; that targets mostly Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs we shed on Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University presented a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to perform
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous image we are making in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ word ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sho@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for the fact that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet can now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given to them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who have made me a vital Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a lo@@ af of bread in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make our humanity exist , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics are talking about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people have been enth@@ r@@ alled by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago even science of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of consciously and un@@ consciously strengthening the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we had no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
can there be a way to connect to someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
&quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot;
&quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening often is linked to understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to , to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first present their story in their own language and then translate or interpret them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and representation make it possible for the audience to get involved . &quot;
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ able of rab@@ bits and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS to organize their own story telling . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish state debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Vatican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano pe@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico are demanding that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debts must be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed salary related to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with falling pension payments .

&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :

&quot; the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , an event was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist from the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ market Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available license @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of repression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with this .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted in the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us begin thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the military police had taken Bass@@ el as a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , it was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Siegel , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ vision@@ ally than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types f@@ use with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to exter@@ min@@ ate this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet finished this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent all my life with it , dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book@@ cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is done &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that every one of the dangers does not care me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the gar@@ rison of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bash@@ ar &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have van@@ ished according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested , or disappeared under the rule of violence by the regime , were tortured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot;
&quot; Mozambique : due to corruption , director after release convic@@ ted of corruption again on previous post &quot;
&quot; in anger , Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for a total of 54 million me@@ tics ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ ba@@ za ruled between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on 19 April then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not carry any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people do not welcome the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary action against the infrin@@ gement .
&quot; the company , however , apparently remained silent and did not cause reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had lowered . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re @-@ integrated into the company , which he helped inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
contradictory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ ale : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serves to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served itself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for ever as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he energe@@ tically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person would be able to sell also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; sentenced to 22 years in prison , Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 10 years and released . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; Be@@ ans &quot; &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dimin@@ ishing con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ mag is usually associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech . &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( Cur@@ tain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ats believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dre@@ ad@@ ful nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , spreading the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish its posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards did not meet . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has ensured a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which didn &apos;t contain any hate speech , but were removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot using permission .
&quot; the post says , &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot using permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their votes and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is intended to fuel the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring under control the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have looked better in context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ m Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere with the fact that age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as , every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children with 15 already married , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed to abol@@ ish laws on child marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to tell the critics of the child &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ ned , take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was adopted against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it , and no one voted against it . &quot;
&quot; after it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws on child marriage were finally am@@ ended .
&quot; Lov@@ ell Francis , Facebook member , who has a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and that is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought it was long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot;
the law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age @-@ bearing age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment to the law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Trou@@ ble @-@ Schil@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought for him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hin@@ du organisation in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to have made his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; if we , instead of talking about the problem , we would like to talk specifically about that the state , our daughters against it , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men , which are beneficial to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or continues to be the norm , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was hack@@ ed from the district of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l . hack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; Abi@@ de home . &quot; &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the page - but in the cache it was retained . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ news to the local news service that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents again . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many technologi@@ cally experienced Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN presence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the internet law ( n ° 56@@ 51 ) was passed . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the world &apos;s most famous country when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform still remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is , in spite of legal prohibition , but retri@@ ev@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to place snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform , so it is possible to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ ors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
one attacks another URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
&quot; a su@@ h@@ len@@ se rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he rose from face to face with tig@@ ers , &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ zz@@ ard appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wild animals , however , is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , mostly in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern@@ es in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations . &quot;
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women with greatest care should avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a mock court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had approached a married family with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is common among men . however , they have far less allow@@ ances to fear , if at all which , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health guards and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ inter has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s council to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads the club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round acted by women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; not saying al@@ oud the name of her hus@@ bands is a custom , which they have all du@@ ly maintained and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; initially , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; practice , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on with his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first round of discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say their husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us what they want , does it mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ys from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she smoked only in front of himself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole ten@@ se fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each club club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who they could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
&quot; since their marriage , some women in the group have only been wearing sar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ a @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ user , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their choice of clothing , mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of cor@@ rid@@ ors ( upper shirts ) into a discussion lap so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tasted it a couple of times , but then they stopped telling the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , still make it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be attacks of attacks in Mozambique .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of young people for organ trade , probably for dis@@ believing uses , is worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , declared the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , which is the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the implementation of a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Muslim police warned following the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bra in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of its organs in the district of Mor@@ r@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably dis@@ believing rituals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ICH fo@@ sters a country where people would like to go to the streets , to claim sex against good marks , work and other services , a nation in which people would not hurt or even make their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for dis@@ believing uses or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are hun@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district mur@@ mu@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , and the police officer Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald : &quot;

&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons acting as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information . &quot;
&quot; until today , until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , Bas@@ que &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we show the honor of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime , or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even kill@@ ings . &quot;

&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he deemed it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some foreign reactions .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway collap@@ sed after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to re @-@ record the salmon @-@ exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top @-@ level diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as announced in an Declaration on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to abol@@ ish all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ ch announced that the Americans wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as to help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release Li@@ u not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US Embassy &apos;s call drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the top priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;

&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the chance to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact someone outside , including his attor@@ neys . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls on China to preserve its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the per@@ missi@@ les for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an Declaration on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately record it . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means for political reform and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called upon China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very much in an explanation on 28 June for Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished , had led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ly , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they were compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a duty of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re will emerge from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he tar@@ ried corresponding questions with non @-@ answers rational .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to settle this point as long as he was paid in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; as An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that you should start reading the whole message of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , it obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of an advancing generation , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the minister of justice said of Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard who expected me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes he is right and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; believe a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must our prime minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; according to Journey of a Dec@@ ade , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question posed by me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live in Japan again and again . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is deemed cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook in@@ war@@ dly in anger when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag clearly to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
on the other hand Americans ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter if I would like to conf@@ use myself with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can push yourself . &quot;
being harmless means being in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main feature of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada really sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ aded Tha@@ il@@ ands jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop @-@ band in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the Jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these photos of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program to &quot; change the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which over@@ sees online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly opposed to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ation ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East Asia Minor , above all in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked on Soviet @-@ sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and shr@@ ub@@ s live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ cho@@ uk@@ ho@@ v@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
&quot; the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why do I speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were congreg@@ ational centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they pull back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ chan@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
&quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; they said we could cultivate cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , she reminds herself of the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
&quot; but over time , it lost its anxiety . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , however , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right . &quot;
I remember every day as the city and the war once were .
&quot; as our conversation turns towards the end , a little boy is running past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who cares about their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink brick frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys them medication which they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a beard @-@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it fits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children there . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel the track together and that the Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived before in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived there for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he fled to people with his wife and his three children , who wanted to press money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ person , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they shared news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remote control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and the south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet based on Twitter &quot; images from mainland China &quot; , &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checked if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
images from mainland China &quot; have also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description that causes the software to lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council to minimize dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions related to the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when they operate their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi in order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; terrorist &quot; &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ enses , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death &quot;
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; S@@ leep or Death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and find that you are alone in a place where everything is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both from within and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters become transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the A@@ xis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were ri@@ pped from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a sum@@ p@@ tuous picture that filled my expectations whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow , nothing can give you back your voice , after you put it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes looked at me .
&quot; and you dare to look into my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equ@@ als with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose until today .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I give all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , they have given me a bigger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I must sit immediately without waiting for permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old proven communication method : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ com@@ rade was a &quot; first person . &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the Doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all numbers . &quot;
perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop right away .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would let him free if I remain .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ori@@ ze on the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear it scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ am , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that presented the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; &quot; th@@ under &quot; , &quot; reference to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; with this , the secret was venti@@ l@@ ated : to protect the security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational greeting card and betra@@ yed the close gaze of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de on him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will eventually come to an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry was not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a waste collector or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
&quot; within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electrically charged bar . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and hurry , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he slides to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch . &quot;
&quot; however , what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel accomplished his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ low@@ ye@@ en ( like : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposed to the conservative majority and interro@@ gated her old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his mind , and he can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance to oppose the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed of the second generation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds , &quot; I think so , because I am a human being , &quot; while he poured into two cups dissolved in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gul@@ lies speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ v@@ asses of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary groups supporting the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement . &quot;
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism which poses the old legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continued to &quot; opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting a clear emerging reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b restored traditional gender standards by eliminating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tro@@ dden unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they actually should trust .
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch , according to Human Rights Watch , reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be deta@@ ined in@@ definitely in prison &quot; , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not be able to do anything . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was in@@ timi@@ dated by me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b addresses the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in essence can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , where you can get what you want &quot; - whether it &apos;s faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ dy@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been extensively cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , stre@@ amed but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ clear , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , didn &apos;t have anything to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government decre@@ es and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they had critical comments on the problems associated with the deep @-@ rooted corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the ar@@ dar@@ s , drums and dancing mar@@ ched over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous population of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !

I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .

young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outer appearances and body care have rarely been as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the bar@@ ber art , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because from love to children , we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to receive affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question left the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal detention for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians should join together and help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need much more need@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people this year , which needed urgent assur@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC comb@@ at@@ ants who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I would never have thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they did before to counter the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can be tra@@ vers@@ ed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of war , it was tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to handle weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already a war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC stated the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the nation affects the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can help to make society more equ@@ itable in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and realizing that the people I have often seen as monsters , and even hate people with beautiful feelings that have been turned up@@ side down by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - including those who have done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dre@@ aming of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article auth@@ ored by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ ova and its first publication on the website OC Media .
&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the LG@@ BT@@ Q community in the LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that dealt with the delay , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ former , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced the sex marriage of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; in the last analysis , she moved out of fear for her life to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I was told someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while trying to help her , someone of whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents , spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the lap . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the rear seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to honour the family , you shame ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung . &quot;
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some perfectly unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to return me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by doing so without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad excuse , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; it was too much for my mother , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark window pan@@ es and a license plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering , without identification , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you wouldn &apos;t believe , you would be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; we don &apos;t talk about gender equ@@ ation , but this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person you remember from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do ? those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; for them , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who was eating in ar@@ gun for a month and a half .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives to place themselves in Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for a year and a half .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ards had grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already familiar in Grand@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to approach us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never bent my hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t complain about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
people often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
&quot; when he became Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality in television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic deterior@@ ated steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I join them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
&quot; I have discovered these people myself , when I steal the variety of them . &quot;
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sh@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
&quot; this is the nature , which has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what the cab@@ ar@@ ins have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ ent men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month , some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fall@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to live their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community resi@@ des in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of spon@@ ges , the water from the Arabic regions in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who were looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak of Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab states have to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally all be Femin@@ ist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I am suffering twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I speak on skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; raise their votes and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to attain equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we face black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way .
or that black women and women from other ethnic and country of origin deserve less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take injusti@@ ces in her mind , referring both to the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my membership in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a men@@ ace and margin@@ alized being in the historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and sex . for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origin a home and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : recall We can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
padd@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here . &quot;
&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a repeatedly travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the main focus of her work is on pursued , little noted sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ ert@@ . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # nun ) reported about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a Police In@@ spec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had been violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed up for mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s clear indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also used nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever file an ad , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must contact the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that contains nothing subject to Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General issued 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of it was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were over 5,000 ads for domestic violence in peace courses . here again , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman who charges ad in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder is not an own criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that doesn &apos;t stop
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise : &quot;
I would never have thought I would ever be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about this , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had liked it so long by Carlos , and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner had har@@ assed her . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ an &apos;s case , everything began with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her ex partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay Law : good approach , inadequate implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was introduced in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ sie ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law envis@@ ages to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal record and to punish them harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legal text has been changed in some ways in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be banned , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay , and are pun@@ ishable by up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which the victims of violence must carry on their own , if they just want to submit ads and receive a secure lodging , to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking has to take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; whoever is silent in the face of these facts , makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will be punished . &quot;
&quot; we have to refund as long as possible , until ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors from Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then he has been suffering , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , the chief mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterized by the persist@@ ence of security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , restric@@ ting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the paper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article was published in the paper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bound hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the cover page with the title : &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , was invited by ISS to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces at his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was held before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
&quot; the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences , and also ordered the final closing of the paper . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were convic@@ ted , among other things , due to disorder of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic reefs ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit was set in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic reefs ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month jail sentence from the Central P@@ rison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he served his one @-@ year sentence .
&quot; in addition , the Court of Appe@@ al raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; despite the Court &apos;s decision to release Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Cuban government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another directive in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to : &quot;
1 . un@@ condition@@ ally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2 . creating a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial sh@@ kan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and freedom of association and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment to investigate these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research conducted by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus even before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media on this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a maker myself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as finance and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not previously ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity and water and internet . RW
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
GV : can you describe us the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . RW :
&quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ attering , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants , such as cereals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security around the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to p@@ addle .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ our@@ ing not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and eaten red Roman Sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ dens in the &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot;
&quot; it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can use the seeds bred by them freely . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately exclude - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ded professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all species of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the lin@@ ings of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making other seeds available to others , as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always limited . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specific traits - from those , which improve their taste or colour until such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing for more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and vital for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property owners place other breeders , as &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; therefore , such protection does not prevent innovation , but fo@@ sters it by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees things differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed crops that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources .
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is precisely opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders are more innovative with the avoid@@ ance of plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I always need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; breeding rules differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; one explanation is , however , not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which the official start @-@ up should be scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported the above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a comment on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains in spite of this attack and the violation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should defend the law and to give victims a voice . although it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &apos;s Qatar network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web @-@ side closures . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in the Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video , as the police practiced physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gging blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) They succeeded in communicating the feeling of a state of siege , an attempt to arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
virtual private networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) also documented the blocking of providers by enabling internet cens@@ orship and private surfing .
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered . &quot;
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering information on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .
&quot; the Brazilian army deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;
&quot; photo by : Est@@ ado Mai@@ or ( C@@ ML ) via photos of P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ as , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the country &apos;s second @-@ largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , which , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not a reason for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when distorted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure the atro@@ cities of the police that first shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ nings per state , Rio is on 16th place , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; specially the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , has been empha@@ sizing how C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia has been empha@@ sizing the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this did indeed lead to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , U@@ PP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . to this end , entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
&quot; a week ago , the police cleared up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : learn besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from a brutal siege and block@@ ade , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 challenged the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed outside Damascus , which led residents to rely on locally produced , tunnels and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ age , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not part of the traditional food in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; right from the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
&quot; in order to raise money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to teach 125 families to cultivate mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
&quot; after that , they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . as this was done , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al culture for various reasons : &quot; break of siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant up in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government spending the last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days .
&quot; fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country , reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photographs alone , in 2017 , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; whole Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :
that &apos;s Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ gos@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow a better insight into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the goal of the protests on Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures through the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal stated the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again in June as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ ranging proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that all could be built , &quot; &quot; leads Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of readily flamm@@ able wood , grow , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems add to the fact that the website of the Portugal Civil Protection Act on October 15th and 16th , when residents were looking for information or trying to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt , it informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war had erup@@ ted between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother did not tell it so then , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the dawn , the boy should break open . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of Haz@@ ara , always came closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years , he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , like today , the lives of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran have been shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services and no heating there . we suspended nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without official papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which may go for months following the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unt@@ amed ré@@ gi@@ me helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af has put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Lux@@ ury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans run businesses , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade , and aim to return to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill liber@@ ates social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for over 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
share @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users need to be able to use social networks , to register within six months of the successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
&quot; if you miss this step , you may be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the fin@@ ing of a pen@@ al payment . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which severe pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high civil servant would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management was forced to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ loading of including weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iz@@ a spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
listen to Tunisi@@ an activists to insp@@ ected documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s independent media platform and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would provide am@@ nesty to the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ justi@@ fiable funds . &quot;
&quot; the document released on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the prime plans to support the bill of legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he stood in the district court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Council of People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
the regulations also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have suggested in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ str@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ruled the ban on Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was closed because it was &quot; a source of information gathered together with groups to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is blocking the website completely . it is , apart from among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
&quot; following this week &apos;s secured documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install the backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has abandoned other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
