<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American movie."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," "I was, as if it is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very warm letter of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he walks with his narrow-mindedness."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, how a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential elections was the highest number, who had ever reached a candidate nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people that I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that embraces people from all over the world, a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the world outlook was not consistent with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"my intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits Kristi Kappes's commitment, which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Kloey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump saw his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most white are voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, do they want to say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks different with contempt for those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(N.B.: as much as" muting the whites against all other ethnicities "; word game from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, but it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president twice the son of a Kenyaner whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else would be possible anywhere in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America that promises and says:" hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is at the helm again, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd shouted.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices became louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later, he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trump Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close link with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the turmoil you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays Capital - play on instruments made of recycled waste materials:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chávez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made of trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article by Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"that changed when Favio had been shown something, which he had never seen before: a violin made from waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and him are the poorest - like humans in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content together.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa visited."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offender of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Administration. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it wasn't able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had expelled from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. FISH-i offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships, when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark vessels that are fishing in forbidden areas, such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can, on the basis of this information, deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the network HISH-i lose each year due to illegal fishermen that penetrate East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as sailing under a false flag, fake license papers, imaginary names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "says Long." "in the past a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You must not run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and just this legal loophole tries FISH-i to close now."</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used multiple fraudulent identities, and it has tracked and found escape ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to track down the illegal vessels that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland, therefore, helps build a system that combines different levels of information. it aims to help FISH-i find criminal-acting ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed by the position of every single tracking ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "meeting with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what to do - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used to fuse without a license earlier and hardly had to face consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors were found on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "Kiilu says." "we have become an object of study." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there have been six countries united in 2015, so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With certainty the goal of even more such initiatives and structures can be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph. in October, it was Greko 1, a ship sailing under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also entered into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that such a collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">"when he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city Córdoba."</seg>
<seg id="200">"as a grown-up man, Quijano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba."</seg>
<seg id="201">"in the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept family secrets for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>
<seg id="208">"at that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmereofficer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in La Perla prison until 1978."</seg>

<seg id="213">"no, this is the story of Luis Quianos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father."</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power is a parent of his child and how this child chose a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">"when my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts."</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">"you are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP."</seg>
<seg id="221">"just hope that they won't kidnap you one day, and I have to save you."</seg>

<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">"on the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner."</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">"the prisoners are tortured,"</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">"during the first and last time, he let me wait at the entrance in the car."</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of this was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I sped in, and saw a couch lying on men."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom hold a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured it with water and hunted him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that someone can do so much harm to another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and were brought to the eye."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were facing down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people munched still on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I was seeing the prisoners, he said," "Why do you look so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you bring me up?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero found a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to information from survivors of the civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera trial, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the path on which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war spoils'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "war spoils" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military later - I was in the gendarmerie - I realized that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps military sign that one has fought against an enemy that has been fought.</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I always asked myself how my father, the leader of the security forces, could participate in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal and I replied," "And you, who stealds your cars on the street?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with rage, beat me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you individually."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"as I said in the trial, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll-collar jumper made of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but nevertheless he brought home clothes."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a conjurer in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me under the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to tell.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you realize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you executed people during the dictatorship. but why did the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did not these people also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." "you'll never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But of course something remains forever.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even participated in the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations about all the atrocities I had to experience for his sake.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly repelled and asked myself why the whole exaggerated patriotism and" "Western and Christian feelings" "which they allegedly defended were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something like that?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he only replied," "Then show me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I made the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can reproach me that I am preoccupied. I finally told my own father.</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong their driving license, witnessed a particularly missuccessful translation in the last month."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign the Japanese word" "older driver" "(koreisssha), which means" older motorists "- was wrongly translated - perhaps even with vicious ambush thoughts & # 8212; as" terrible drivers. ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Joshua Levine's original photos that have been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, an inhabitant of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun, which appeared in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was initially removed. the designation" "drivers" "(German:" "terrible motorists" ") was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" "elder drivers" "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the prefecture of Kyoto apologized to the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text, which they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely apologize that elderly people felt offended by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">"the Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of" "terrible" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents is quite a matter of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the prefecture of Kyoto, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens generated 1,803 of 11,850 accidents."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have a foreign workforce do not allow translations to be produced internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is rated as the best, becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the controversial and puzzling phrases that arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery, acceptable, or at least harmless. but of large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the city of Kyoto, hopefully, will use a reputable source for its translation in the future."</seg>

<seg id="394">Other online stations also overtook photographs of the protests in Caracas that were organized by oppositional groups who oppose the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>

<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen, "edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride she spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she started working as a criadita for the family."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her minor son or her minor daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, education and a roof over his head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Crimean Azgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated against the Criadita is generally not silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double delusion," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family who has her daughter in the belief that she can complete her education, improve her position in society and" "do something out of herself", "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who receives the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training, and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan stewards, has a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed a lot of heavy blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira moved on a stick to Marín until she suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They marked the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest rallies and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos became widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay than children," Tina Alvarenga lamented. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes from court, the case of Carolina Marín could be pointing out - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes in court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his job."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street, or on the market to make money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that her still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food." "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge", "she remembers."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was part of the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="500">"image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is adopted by the Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would be established, which is mandated to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register their correct names and identity numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a buckle."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and curated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" Any Application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text. ""</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities should account for the registration. it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and got a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technician at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, "said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" stands in accordance with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximised and ensured that no divergent narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the parliamentary group Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legal action against cyber crime in which a life sentence for those found guilty of threatening" "threatens public order" "and" "protest". ""</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the horseshoe Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger leopard family, which strikes through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "The Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and flourishing of the ecosystem is also dependent on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out pure pleasure."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the north-east of Japan, documented the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture has been a major prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had left whole coastal towns disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, already because of that, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the sufferers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare homes were completed in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned spare homes were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, it is still endeavouring to relocate six years after the disaster, evacuated by shelter camps (" "" "s," "Kazaketsu juutaku" ") into final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"more than 75 per cent of those who survived after disaster in shelter shelters, were resettled into final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fukushima lie in the" "nuclear barrier zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three Prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same level, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can have only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper declares:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey yielded that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed that there was still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 people from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled into permanent placements."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated ones are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar cane mills throughout Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the fall, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory lost its facilities until only the skeleton of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">"others resigned and commute daily to the factories, which are still grinding."</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which have been in operation after a long period of time because they were preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembers the fact that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories to produce the sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound has to remain, according to the 2016 report" "Agricultural perspectives" "of the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Nutrition Organization."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>

<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was overgrown and the letters were more and more frequent."</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip-hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Record of a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014, to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop addresses the fact that the young participants discuss topics such as" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">"for the most part, the cases have not been clarified."</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the theme of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people had not always mastered the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung at Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody is ever interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"so they can grow, and also to advance our youth."</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">"in the comment section, the reader and defender of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllabus (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):"</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "Plastics models of the dishes" ") from any dish that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see themselves these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend now transforms them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new with plastic dishes decorated mobile phone bands, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essentials is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case ikura is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon cheating? ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members pleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">For more bizarre plastic dishes you can look at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # 1 of the many "" s "" "</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you like to learn more about the origins of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. like the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trade" "in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, was completely pushing the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "learning to live with drug trade" "), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video titled" "Vicky que Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "how Fear Changing Life" "tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on only one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have asked ourselves to go and look for tombs, according to the people we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he was to be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you stand for my father's insurance, but she doesn't pay it out because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come by newspaper kiosks and see the pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or acts of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is great. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroic deeds" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the infirmity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were" soaking. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been plundered by threats. "it describes how armed criminals pressured money from their business month by the end, but also torn apart their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain passing never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as they do not know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked myself whether wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence-drawn generation." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, keep tortillas warm and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"they are, however, insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8,5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tortured the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something emerged the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of image and event -" wrong description "or" wrong context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank truck fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped, including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people looking at the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But history does not end here.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters from the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Govon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses dramatically reported atrocities before which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one left behind to count corpses," "said a man on Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated graphically."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here, the image from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack:"</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this improper use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further personal comments such as this example falsely affect the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a Blitzkrieg, published by the United Nations described those who could flee punches, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following published these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news site, falsely claiming that the President of Myanmar Than had said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims."</seg>

<seg id="928">"there are two strong themes or frames (frames), which pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion."</seg>

<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and are the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the restraining of images of a refusal is equal, to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot of debate about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used from context or completely misuse."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the Vatican Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Ciudadano peor la Auditoría de la Deuda) and the ecumenical church assembly in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico are demanding that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for the debts must be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in the public debt, with a fixed salary related to our working conditions, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"the people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt, which is not theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with falling pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit organisation without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and convictions of citizens, measures imposed on the outside will be jeopardized by the people."</seg>

<seg id="1182">"the Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year."</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">"more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"at this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin, an event was dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist from the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Aftermarket Research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available license-free, contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of repression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was painted in the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us begin thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the military police had taken Bassel as a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, it was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its whereabouts remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Siegel, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more provisionally than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types fuse with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to exterminate this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel has not yet finished this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent all my life with it, dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a prosabuch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have vanished according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">"those who were arrested, or disappeared under the rule of violence by the regime, were tortured or even executed."</seg>
<seg id="1250">"by 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in custody since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1253">"today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time."</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: due to corruption, director after release convicted of corruption again on previous post"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"in anger, Mozambique reacted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"it is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defendants for a total of 54 million metics (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza ruled between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on 19 April then."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not carry any disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people do not welcome the action."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary action against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, apparently remained silent and did not cause reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" conflicting ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had lowered."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be re-integrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any morale:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and serves to serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served itself only by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself, this man has become tired, charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to the prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are part of the prison Samora Machel and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for ever as a first independent president, but also as a sharp, incisive and - by the way - prophetic speakers."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was, when he energetically confirmed that" an ambitious person would be able to sell also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is at the same time criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also negative:"</seg>
<seg id="1282">"sentenced to 22 years in prison, Cambaza was sentenced to 10 years and released."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or chickpeas.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar "or" "Beans" "(in Burma) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely diminishing connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today Kalar'mag is usually associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (Curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the set ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hats believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before it extinguishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dreadful nationalists, spreading hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, spreading the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to extinguish its posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post from Facebook was removed and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post" Facebook Community standards did not meet. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has ensured a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which didn't contain any hate speech, but were removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"the post says," If you are a doctor, then heal people? ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot using permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their votes and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is intended to fuel the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the territory of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring under control the balancing hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word" Kalar, "it would have looked better in context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament adopted unanimously a law that should prohibit this practice, so that the age-capable age is now at 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harryperm Maharaj, a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere with the fact that age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, the minors as, every person under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"UN statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children with 15 already married, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements aimed to abolish laws on child marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to tell the critics of the child's marriage, they should, damned, take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was adopted against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it, and no one voted against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws on child marriage were finally amended.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Lovell Francis, Facebook member, who has a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk, which disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? the child marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal, and that is worth almost any price."</seg>
<seg id="1361">"while Abel Jackson thought it was long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:"</seg>
<seg id="1362">"public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:"</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!!"</seg>
<seg id="1365">"Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, which openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:"</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-bearing age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">"the draft for the amendment to the law was adopted today, on 9 June 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present in the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for over a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technologically experienced Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN presence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the internet law (n ° 5651) was passed."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the world's most famous country when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform still remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content is, in spite of legal prohibition, but retrievable."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (via the locking of Wikipedia), we set everything to place snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform, so it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklope.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he rose from face to face with tigers,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buzzard appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wild animals, however, is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, mostly in a tent to take pictures of Otternes in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women with greatest care should avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a mock court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had approached a married family with name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also is common among men. however, they have far less allowances to fear, if at all which, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health guards and housewives, came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Painter has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's council to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads the club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round acted by women who don't call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not saying aloud the name of her husbands is a custom, which they have all duly maintained and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"initially, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"practice, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first round of discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say their husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they all asked," If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can tell us what they want, does it mean that they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pays from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking an age-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she smoked only in front of himself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole tense frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided they would actually try to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped doing so, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at each club club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who they could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"since their marriage, some women in the group have only been wearing saris."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Sala-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trouser, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their choice of clothing, morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of corridors (upper shirts) into a discussion lap so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tasted it a couple of times, but then they stopped telling the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, still make it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for" "Subversion" "after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius as an" "internal affair" "and told a speaker that he deemed it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Prize laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries criticized the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"a spokesman, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway collapsed after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to re-record the salmon-exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top-level diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as announced in an Declaration on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to abolish all the limitations of Mr. Lius's wife and family members."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced AFP on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release Liu not only Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the US Embassy's call drew a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Foreign Ministry that" "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to preserve its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the permissiles for the exercise of these rights."</seg>

<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished, had led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem silly, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they were compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "twist the logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a duty of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns that are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre will emerge from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried corresponding questions with non-answers rational.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to settle this point as long as he was paid in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that you should start reading the whole message of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country, it obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of an advancing generation, who makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the minister of justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard who expected me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes he is right and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "believe a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our prime minister pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"according to Journey of a Decade, the magazine Journey of a Decade tends to be a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but this is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question posed by me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>

<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is deemed courteous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians cook inwardly in anger when they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians attach a Canadian flag clearly to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1768">"first, to be called" "nice" "means to be idle - like the good-natured, gentle yet tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" "The Simpsons" "(who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can push yourself."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main feature of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop-band in Thailand has released a music video that parodicates the Junta, which seized power in 2014 and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy, in particular how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these photos of the video, which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconical section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the infamous program to" change the settings "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons viewed by the Junta as critics."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which oversees online content and accused persons accused of having slandered the monarchy, prosecuted."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico," Mama Africa "is home to migrants on their long journey"</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula. it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink brick frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, brittle walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"there is no sign for the hotel, but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, she buys them medication which they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a beard-beard) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it fits her, because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastian travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children there."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on the way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel the track together and that the Africans already speak to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived before in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's the reason I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula are from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras he fled to people with his wife and his three children, who wanted to press money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single-person, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travelers will calmly consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots, she made an art din, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeated every time. "they are gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" prevents access to terrorist information. ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could use the app for more than fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they shared news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remote control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and the south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet based on Twitter" images from mainland China "," the censored news published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen were randomly checked if they had installed the surveillance app. "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Images from mainland China "have also published a Jingwang product description that causes the software to lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions related to the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when they operate their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi in order to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "terrorist" "videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offenses, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1998">One that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters become transformed into beings of flesh and blood, and all screams after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence, even if the Earth is spinning on the Axis of Unheils. it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were ripped from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all neighborhoods were coveted, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stuffed up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a sumptuous picture that filled my expectations wholeheartedly."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you become aware that you liberate the mind from the lamp, but it simply does not interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow, nothing can give you back your voice, after you put it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan begins to say:" let me hear how you cry "Allahu Akbar," or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes looked at me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you dare to look into my eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was about my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I have never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence lies in my nose until today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>

<seg id="2036">"unlike anything else, they have given me a bigger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one more prisoner, and I must sit immediately without waiting for permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old proven communication method: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell-comrade was a "first person."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and is called" the Doctor. ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no distinctive features can be seen in me, and doctors do not exist here; we are all numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop right away.</seg>

<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"with this, the secret was ventilated: to protect the security against us and to prevent us from exposing the betrayer and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - so they played their denominational greeting card and betrayed the close gaze of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, which here is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet on Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me like that."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that glide on him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will eventually come to an end anyway. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, though I had done nothing to make this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cry was not enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a waste collector or if it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them alternated, while I was still in line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it, which is why he resorted to an electrically charged bar."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which seemed to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my father has to worry terribly."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and hurry, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>

<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special reluctance to oppose the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as the" Palestinian winged of the second generation. ""</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds," I think so, because I am a human being, "while he poured into two cups dissolved in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the gullies speak lukewarm coffee and the wavasses of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordaniens has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary groups supporting the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which poses the old legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights "which continued to" opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflecting a clear emerging reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib restored traditional gender standards by eliminating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently trodden unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of 'Honorary murders' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch, according to Human Rights Watch, reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be detained indefinitely in prison", "and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not be able to do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intimidated by me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib addresses the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in essence can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, where you can get what you want" - whether it's faith or non-belief, heterody- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been extensively censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to remember later that his comments were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, streamed but only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuclear, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, didn't have anything to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government decrees and members of the teacher association, arguing that they had critical comments on the problems associated with the deep-rooted corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" experiencing it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the ardars, drums and dancing marched over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous population of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of an 18-meter-tall car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearances and body care have rarely been as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which takes place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the barber art, which enables them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:"</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because from love to children, we have built this educational community."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel ejected to receive affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question left the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal detention for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians should join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need much more needful."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people this year, which needed urgent assurances."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC combatants who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never have thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they did before to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can be traversed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, "explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed lay a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and he said," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of war, it was tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to handle weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as already a war, and the FARC already acted in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC stated the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the nation affects the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can help to make society more equitable in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "one of them said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and realizing that the people I have often seen as monsters, and even hate people with beautiful feelings that have been turned upside down by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - including those who have done so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now focusing on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dreaming of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat posed by the LGBTQ community in the LGBTQ community has not only been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published that dealt with the delay, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world" ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transformer, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens experienced the sex marriage of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"in the last analysis, she moved out of fear for her life to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while trying to help her, someone of whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents, spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents through WhatsApp made the lap."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the rear seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you want to honour the family, you shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some perfectly unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to return me to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by doing so without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad excuse, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"it was too much for my mother, and she put a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with dark window panes and a license plate with a 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without identification, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you wouldn't believe, you would be safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"we don't talk about gender equation, but this is a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person you remember from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do? those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for them, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who was eating in argun for a month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives to place themselves in Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for a year and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003, I was already familiar in Grandny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to approach us to" "civilisation", "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't complain about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he became Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic deteriorated steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, meetings, I join them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"I have discovered these people myself, when I steal the variety of them."</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidshab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, which has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have what the cabarins have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transient men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to feel ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the past few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi-human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month, some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Fallah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who were helpless and unable to live their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community resides in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of sponges, the water from the Arabic regions in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among Arab Ahawzi young people now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who were looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% finished secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their home."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and thus be hired, because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak of Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab states have to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation is explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionality"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally all be Feminist * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" raise their votes and to sing "Kumbaya, my Lord," in order to attain equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we face black women in a twofold way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnic and country of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take injustices in her mind, referring both to the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my membership in a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a menace and marginalized being in the historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex. for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origin a home and to distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word" feminism "still lies in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recall We can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this contribution by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"Nabil Musa repeatedly travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years, mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "Musa tells."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the main focus of her work is on pursued, little noted subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques, whose help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurert. the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# nun) reported about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a Police Inspector told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had been violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman Balbuena showed up for maltreatment, Ada Báez's clear indication of Ada Báez also used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever file an ad, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must contact the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strikes and Statistics 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that contains nothing subject to Paraguayan laws: good approach, inadequate implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General issued 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of it was violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5,000 ads for domestic violence in peace courses. here again, 86% of women's ads came."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"these statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman who charges ad in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this," she said at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder is not an own criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" without complicity, no impunity. # Non-Less "photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that doesn't stop</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want that, but then she gave up. this should be regrettable for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought I would ever be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about this, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming a name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had liked it so long by Carlos, and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner had harassed her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorian's case, everything began with mental mistreatment."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a process against her former partner who developed into an unsearchable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her ex partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay Law: good approach, inadequate implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but cannot be applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a way of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was introduced in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# fürsie)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the motion # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law envisages to explain Femizid to an independent criminal record and to punish them harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legal text has been changed in some ways in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the path for decriminalisation of abortions would be banned, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay, and are punishable by up to five years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill was intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, which the victims of violence must carry on their own, if they just want to submit ads and receive a secure lodging, to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking has to take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"whoever is silent in the face of these facts, makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators will be punished."</seg>
<seg id="2538">"we have to refund as long as possible, until ill treatment is no longer considered normal."</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation."</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: there are many medicines and vaccines missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment to investigate these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research conducted by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a post doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus even before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media on this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the bian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a maker myself."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as finance and development chances are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not previously?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity and water and internet. RW</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here. RW:</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment (the so-called" "Paywall" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outshattering, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only valid for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants, such as cereals or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security around the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but it takes longer since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if there is a boulder in a river that I have to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavouring not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and eaten red Roman Salat of the variety Outreddens in the" "greenhouse" "of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can use the seeds bred by them freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately exclude - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerided professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all species of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "he says and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the linings of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making other seeds available to others, as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always limited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specific traits - from those, which improve their taste or colour until such, because they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing for more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto's spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and vital for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property owners place other breeders, as" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"therefore, such protection does not prevent innovation, but fosters it by providing the public with more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees things differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed crops that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation of mass herbicides are needed, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precisely opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders are more innovative with the avoidance of plant patents:" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I always need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years," he says. "with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"breeding rules differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"one explanation is, however, not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for open source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, for which the official start-up should be scheduled next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blogging blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) They succeeded in communicating the feeling of a state of siege, an attempt to arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post items to bypass the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">Virtual private networks (VPNs) also documented the blocking of providers by enabling internet censorship and private surfing.</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how to block websites that VPNs offered."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering information on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos of Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second-largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Diebe rob pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and airwaves to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the Violence of Violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in this way, the newspaper" Extra "published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published on 16 August, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., which, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not a reason for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when distorted, can also be used to obscure the atrocities of the police that first shoot and then ask questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it does?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"if we look at the mornings per state, Rio is on 16th place," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"specially the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, has been emphasizing how Cecília has been emphasizing the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"the foundation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this did indeed lead to a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, UPP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of chicans and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war. to this end, entering into the territory of a" enemy "where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost spheres. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from a brutal siege and blockade, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the region of East Ghouta, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 challenged the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been besieged outside Damascus, which led residents to rely on locally produced, tunnels and checkpoints."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockage, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" food-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not part of the traditional food in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"right from the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, like meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>

<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to Cando by Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began the "production of fungal seeds from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"after that, they planted a small mushroom-yard in a tub. as this was done, they used a bigger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant up in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government spending the last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country, reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photographs alone, in 2017, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"whole Portugal is burning in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata (@ a _ ataner) October 15th, 2017"</seg>

<seg id="2845">The goal of the protests on Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures through the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal stated the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">"this Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of open roads, surrounded by fire."</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened again in June as the roads were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a wide-ranging proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that all could be built," "leads João Sorval in the same article of the newspaper Público."</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of readily flammable wood, grow, as in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add to the fact that the website of the Portugal Civil Protection Act on October 15th and 16th, when residents were looking for information or trying to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">"it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: using the application fogos.pt, it informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires."</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and, on this fateful weekend in October, was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires."</seg>

<seg id="2875">"at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of Hazara, always came closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a couple of years, he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, like today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran have been shaped by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services and no heating there. we suspended nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without official papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf returned to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which may go for months following the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untamed régime helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of working in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf has put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food snack.</seg>

<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some of Afghans run businesses, including tailoring, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>

<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
