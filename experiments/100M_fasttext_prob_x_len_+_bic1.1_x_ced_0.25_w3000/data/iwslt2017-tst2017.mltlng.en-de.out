that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is a different chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA has literally handed over dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined its risks and called upon it to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if the media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of separating and spl@@ itting it into statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for it . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly concerned his phone calls , &quot;
&quot; as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel information with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens alleged source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitution , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload or send documents , as with any common contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer provide information secretly , and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the start . &quot;
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that threaten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is up to us to ensure that not only technology experts , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a chance to bring out mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the next environmental officer who al@@ erts alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; at least , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ ack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has brief@@ cases in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting for the next release , and on the next unveiled documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems distant from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are being used to hide and mask their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fees . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ut@@ ors and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the USA .
&quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans , who came to this scandal in these revelations . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ ack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , you need less information in some U.S. states to provide less information to create a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
frau@@ d@@ sters are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked us that all of us made suggestions for our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to anyone else . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our secret investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to deal with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
&quot; that may sound fool@@ ishly , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite well that some have begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has been collecting in central registers on a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA hin@@ ders here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind mock firms .
we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this type of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after finishing my design studies , I made a post@@ age sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the cor@@ ps .
he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ one on toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how to earn something . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes are completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and dropped the door into the castle , Brian and I sat down . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
&quot; my former mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
&quot; thus we presented to investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
over the internet they can then invite wild strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
&quot; no one , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can count on the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic you are feeling right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
your home is the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone .
&quot; visitors can &apos;t just read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel like they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ? &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , could you announce that he is can@@ oni@@ zed for the president &apos;s office ? &quot;
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail to this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first imagined with his name , if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you could have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system , confidence boo@@ sts confidence . &quot;
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give off negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their evaluations before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they relate to age and place of residence .
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stands out for simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you talk too little about it , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one nar@@ rates too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I do vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put off these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been met before .
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to party or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front of the front if trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million nights spent only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for men have trusted each other .
&quot; if trust works , miracles can arise thereby . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save one &apos;s lives , even though they don &apos;t know anybody . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will take place . &quot;
but these relationships behind pure money transactions are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about economic trading .
&quot; but it is now simply to call the &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place one visits , a group there would be waiting for a group there to fill a thoroughly and show one at a bar area from which one has never heard of it ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of sharing their share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project was already started . &quot;
they were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place were
&quot; were taught to people whose children had moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we haven &apos;t invented the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think it &apos;s amazing , &quot;
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : Americans mean , most would not know any Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves you ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels like .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptian , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking out &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others transformed me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I felt -- when we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations which said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t miss . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , sm@@ ashed and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing to ask , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close the mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to the viewing of people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a manager of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family , so that the person thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a beli@@ ever . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people from going to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology based on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she prevented from joining the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect the normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when people submit messages in which Muslims have been neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about explaining itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man gone out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he was shooting at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child seat , we travelled sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people like an exception to rule appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is just about becoming a billi@@ ard business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ par@@ ting has penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter @-@ high tower from 1,@@ 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting each other , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ house load@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are in the room . &quot;
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has major advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that perme@@ ate the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , which together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying devices , which had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying with only one worked .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when everyone is watching me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in vi@@ gil@@ ance , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot;
let us take a look at this .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery -- can continue the machine even if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration shows synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took wholesale micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to imagine new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine , over there , would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in development and creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy . &quot;
this short moment they sh@@ one more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events at first .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cel@@ esti@@ al life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has brought out a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two flas@@ hing black holes ro@@ ared through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when the shaft is over@@ hau@@ led , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and dra@@ ined into the other . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the theory of rel@@ ativity , lec@@ turers often perform a really good dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stressed during the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atom . that is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties of building such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and , with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 and 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because in this way you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; with sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; stupid bo@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; with them , we cannot make simple images of objects in space . &quot;
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the space speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , we can tell about a lot about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , easy : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circuit with an additional key change . that sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement vocabulary that shapes the wa@@ ve@@ form .
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; No@@ body , who knows what to hear , sees this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
&quot; on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot;
&quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars are explo@@ ding in super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen in the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through since these are opa@@ que .
&quot; the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe ins@@ ane , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by his own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that all things exist , which we have never seen before , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first run that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o enables us to take a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang himself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; Yes , &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I start to play with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just to do what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to stop talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I always swear to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like you &apos;re thinking about life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cir@@ cl@@ ed TV . I produced TV .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four episodes : 24 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are shows I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing that ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just sitting on the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is like I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as if you were carrying a high sound , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the hum@@ ming . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could always drive for it . &quot;
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , you do . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I began with television production , when I began to work and to work and to create , create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . &quot;
sum@@ ming is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a h@@ um , you can &apos;t strive for size differently . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know that I &apos;m not do@@ omed to failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more consi@@ gn@@ ments , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are happening at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the army , the screen , the high clay , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out . &quot;
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were stopped . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was an indic@@ ative Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the hum@@ ming was me .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; today , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you do , you do what you do , be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mo@@ m , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the sums when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; South American wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say no when two things are known to me :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m titanium and my bu@@ zz is smo@@ other , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land I created was the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high clay - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing pens and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s silent , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a hum@@ ming . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titanium tree , that &apos;s just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV sessions and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is . &quot;
&quot; sum@@ ming is not a force , and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot;
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depend on love .
the hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust for life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums are simple and original .
&quot; the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic from any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
play does not lie to me in a way that works .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at work than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work as a house ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; titanium &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
&quot; we r@@ attle in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst wire bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
they have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit is replacing me .
&quot; and if my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more . &quot;
everyone can get 15 minutes on the piece even at a bad @-@ m@@ oods @-@ day !
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no linen , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner ready for children .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for his peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
&quot; to play &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will reti@@ re and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why don &apos;t allow for a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the hum@@ ming came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the sum of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the sums , the bu@@ zz , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sums : the hum@@ ming of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , captiv@@ ating , bare and new attitude towards life is spreading within me . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like I &apos;m looking at you to life .
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ am@@ like .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in this process , one electrodes a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really has an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
&quot; often , I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma . &quot;
&quot; you have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain sw@@ ells , and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they distributed slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
&quot; this , however , is not so sure . &quot;
but one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and they subsequently mark color to be able to trace them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the reception of the same individual . &quot;
we call this aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we transplan@@ t these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been transplan@@ ted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tablet .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , they see the monkey picking up spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we transplan@@ ted the cells : the same monkey , two months after implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too .
&quot; since that time , we have found out a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to go through this type of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you have to prove that it is useful before you can treat this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the twin summit parad@@ ox .
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , which , however , are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income that people urgently need , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to blow up the stock markets and rub the real estate prices up . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equi@@ libr@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who would not invest in it . &quot;
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances leading to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus kills him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; his exceedingly wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which free and poor people control the government .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and that it was not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political participation with equal voting rights in matters of state concerns . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle shining bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was del@@ ine@@ ated to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , by gradually sub@@ stit@@ uting politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a flock of predat@@ ors , who so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which she eats , that she is star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has Americ@@ an@@ ised politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash in their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long business and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste acqu@@ ires , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a dise@@ ased surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines are used to serve humans and humans put their energy into the research of the universe , or to indulge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; &quot; A@@ gor@@ a &quot; , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the business sector : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital works from one workplace to the next , from one firm to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour , is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no more distinction between those belonging to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Gruppe of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the amount corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at the time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liber@@ t@@ arian in which she prefers privileged persons , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because she will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is definitely relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not win@@ dy , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the Red@@ ner dinner , you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays - the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to associate liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now to blame , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to us , and the constant denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal - by the way , the first proposal which revealed this denial - &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still chose the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a minister of finance or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims that he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honest interest on sites of len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; no one from the tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , stood by : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone won &apos;t survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930s , what it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studio
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fris@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought field . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows are received .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ted to where , after you looked at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean ou@@ trage , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he has to make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch anyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives out things for free , do you get to know , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of staging a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had gathered all the parts together , they went a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict break@@ through@@ s of flu , the bad type , by analyzing the Google search . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flow into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ inable lots of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items back together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been able otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; this is what the data says to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order to not forget this device , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decision making . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will discuss it later with a technique demo .
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; however , as you know naturally , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic build @-@ up .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
