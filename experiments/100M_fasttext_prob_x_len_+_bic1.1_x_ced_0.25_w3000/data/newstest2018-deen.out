Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution where young people are to meet today .
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small farmers cultivate the former land of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a change road showed a green meadow .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ at@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very revealing . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not recognized as such .
&quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; jud@@ gements &quot; &quot; were incorporated for towns and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian &quot; &quot; survey management &quot; &quot; between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , they originate from the first survey of Bavaria . &quot;
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
&quot; the award for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
the comparison early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ linger was 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots are now no longer occupied by farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the position sheet , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; View on the Venti@@ lation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle Ir@@ ren@@ berg &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; &quot; was built there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to the king Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the buying of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; there was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 seats . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor ren@@ net in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
young people in the Munich subur@@ b of Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um now meet in the area of the former Au@@ er prison .
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments . &quot;
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the shopping cart was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also had a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for Mis@@ sour@@ i State , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to get special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of du@@ bi@@ ous , rac@@ ist incidents have recently occurred throughout the country and be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state , which are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to publish the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries to citizens &apos; rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they will stop because of their skin colour , they will be sm@@ ashed or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ enses against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor , which shows that black mot@@ orists are 75 percent more common in the state than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring in deposit money or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ fence Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac created a picture on site .
&quot; at the right @-@ wing cemetery of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ Location Association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ates in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste there is only regional .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the electric fence project as &quot; elementary &quot; important . &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead to bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the planting of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation , &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot;
farmers are often in cri@@ tique because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced using the electric fence support . &quot;
&quot; the surface area is 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs of € 71 500 were promoted over leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ ladies it &apos;s not going . &quot;
&quot; for Peter Weiss also stood firm : &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Research Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg enables the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding of soft f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a sponsor@@ ship marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the prot@@ rac@@ ted area must not be de@@ fle@@ cted ( slope for 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fischer@@ bacher Hof electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
is nothing holy ?
&quot; now , the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty &quot;
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the proposals of the president for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty insul@@ ators would have smil@@ ed him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took on its significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem on which you relate that was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tired , your poor , / your crowded masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the miserable rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ ding waste &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base knew very well that they took a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to switch it back from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty inv@@ ades no one , but rather an early neo@@ conservative , who brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something here . &quot;
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them in such a way as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear . &quot;
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch should not light the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the power director of the UK &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which started on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner of the street .
whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to a team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete in her fifth world championships at 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which is to be observed after a great season , which was included in the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembered her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be mixed with med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose it makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t get a public office if you cannot tolerate the em@@ power@@ ing of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of doing so at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with its voters and to de@@ bug his ha@@ iry head for chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is considered to be official and of employees paid by public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson attorney Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor , argu@@ ing that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post was talking to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not full of water , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news posting &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guides or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dges James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ to had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters were suggested by his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led next year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links up to the final round before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he established this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 year career . &quot;
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion on home ground . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish Performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ aber . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking a year , &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; back then , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works at Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; according to the manager of the Bau@@ hof Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
the traffic that hin@@ ders construction work again and again represents a major problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o and Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and Death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a , &quot; directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the Stol@@ len Kn@@ ol@@ le is taken and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless area serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , you were not assigned fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch domination , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and corrugated sheets which have been converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and bright rock . &quot;
&quot; previously , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Hill , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an of Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced its value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the states that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence . &quot;
&quot; a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we Will Edit Every@@ thing &quot; means in a report from the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric shock are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ts cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai immig@@ rant who moved to the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native Papua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and bre@@ aches of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the ex @-@ carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua people have changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ho@@ v@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers pier@@ ced their tone and later came back with four soldiers , such as the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ t , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle running continuously and a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators began to throw stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been shared by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called upon the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks ago , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he vo@@ iced sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 , that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism to present historical violations of human rights . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody declaration of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police ra@@ ined on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious husband to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning lights .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , so TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua , attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; people here are building everything they eat , especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot;
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs in the region are usually to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to bring their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; beyond that , international media coverage is ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they gave them a rare permit for filming . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the vice @-@ president of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the states are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ho@@ v@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai wal@@ nuts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sacrifice performed a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the victim &apos;s body was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that turns into the Hoch@@ haus in just two years , that one accidentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ ams of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) fire the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the security of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage was caused by facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Court ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the pro @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two profit sets was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even therefore very much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition so . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the applications .
&quot; not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had come to fill the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 , there are only comparatively minor details : in the following year the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers will find forbidden items to the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items passed by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the aircraft , while they accidentally bore forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had accidentally discovered that they had accidentally traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out for more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet Charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents stated that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent stated that they know@@ ingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally damaged smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many would have done it on purpose .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear through security , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
&quot; fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
Electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la &apos;s head El@@ on Mus@@ k reveals a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing figure for the first time at the announcement of the latest quarterly results : the cancell@@ ations made to the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; booking confirmation &quot; &quot; completely back . &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are taking place in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be put together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are served per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts have doubts that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are greater delays , then the in@@ consistency of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; after all , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from getting away in flocks . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of dela@@ ying the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his earlier decision to delay implementing the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a deadline exp@@ ended on 1 October for states in order to comply with the 2015 standards for the near @-@ floor o@@ zone .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay his compliance with a year , in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or dela@@ ying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ by &apos;s regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementing a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply ampli@@ fies the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; in former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through judicial procedures , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .

Tum@@ lingen Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , is invited to a seren@@ ade at 4.@@ 30@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc their concern .
&quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer original customer book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen with the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , in addition to the former parish church , apart from the former parish church , there was also a wonderful courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not the other way around . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , besides the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; &quot; is the third , the magnificent sett@@ ling centre of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are subject to these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was born from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell rings were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church . &quot;
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the Church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ my Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church steep@@ le was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; only the tower , which still exists today , was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history . &quot;
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ her maintain the Hil@@ arius system as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
&quot; as organis@@ er , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc invite on Sunday , 16th July , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local rec@@ tor Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
&quot; for the seren@@ ade of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers set out fantastic views . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners . &quot;
friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to the care of their homeland as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim restra@@ ined itself &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Council . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; association has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not approve the district government of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf because of a mould failure . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the granted approval requirement is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be reduced , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim n@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issue of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been received at the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; a spokesman explained . &quot;
the circle makes it an occasion to re@@ consider the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; in view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed the lease agreements with the owner of the area around 65 hectares . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ rail households . &quot;
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , four @-@ sens town council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded to death .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot;
city and dealer planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to attract the inhabitants of the shopping expedition to the city centre .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Business Association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for what offers the own city apart from the usual supermarket shelf . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training vac@@ ancies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; in this way , the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offerings , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well festival and selling Sundays , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to actively participate in active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and the ren@@ unciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping from the view .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - up to land@@ lords , the farms of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had partly spread , had predicted King in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will take part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment himself with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump translated after penet@@ rated tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president inv@@ aded him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to leave Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ astic act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury entered the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore by a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this horrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all the audience found a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were spaw@@ ned by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post @-@ job . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ ordination function serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician lays a sheet on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI agents , received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding county were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one was ever charged .
&quot; although susp@@ ects have been on the free foot@@ ing for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice stab@@ bed the FBI of black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she carried did not come from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , gri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe in America no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors pressed - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and listened as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief @-@ C@@ lan@@ member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot;
the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ated by Ras@@ cona .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; yet , &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , clothed with a dream dress , stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
&quot; they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; he mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks in their arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta talked about the post @-@ order with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; Today this is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds yard at his table , he eats and re@@ members the citizen &apos;s rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ order is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf puts on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story stage . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) can be seen as an option of a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car parks where the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as a rock @-@ power , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ tails - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; in Hollywood , K@@ ESS seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , a cor@@ pse in the trunk of Hollywood and gives the Kra@@ pan@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he was troubled .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still needs to believe it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Yan@@ ov@@ sky , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bow to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , will be celebrated stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat back in casual leisure sports@@ wear . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awaited .
&quot; in 2013 , when he had to leave a g@@ ellen@@ ic pipe concert in 2013 , there was a great jubil@@ ation five years later , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations were interrupted . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of how we view it . &quot;
I prefer a positive resume .
Max . works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in a St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at school in the open all day .
what are your experiences with this ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
amount : I did Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully demol@@ ished . &quot;
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably make a social worker training at the University of Her@@ ne and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you are going to be your FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also part of the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
other than civil engineering studies ?
&quot; lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people in the head , who have a different story behind each other . &quot;
whether a refugee has been taken out of the family - one must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; a lot of love , a lot of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts further 3.000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ ten their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of jobs , the Director General John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 points have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured and shared a NATO Declaration .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violent action that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday night when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump sums up the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies , and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday that the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; announced that it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue , and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the EPA &apos;s intention in June to specify the O@@ zone provisions , in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in which parts of the country must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards , in order to delay a year to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Columbia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , is supposed to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the democr@@ ats and nature reserves that concern the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council decides to establish a common room in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land section is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will take some time for the area belonging to the church community to date , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be brid@@ ged by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a space of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are suspended , such a common area is not intended to be a meeting point for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ oren@@ equ@@ itable living , but openly in the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , is due to funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the resolution envis@@ ages to indicate the investor that , in this respect , there is no bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both the saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried sole means this addition . &quot;
when it helps : he passes the body unanim@@ ously .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with which one does not proceed as well , but now I lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I do not do so with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger un@@ condition@@ ally speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but a real , in doubt a market@@ able counter @-@ value , the counter @-@ speech is . &quot;
three pro@@ pon@@ ents are found Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s proposal to split the proposal .
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision in this way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the road
&quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police reported , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the road of Schwar@@ zer towards Hil@@ den , on the bike path of Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the landing fields were on the road , he was obviously not aware of the opposite direction . &quot;
he met with a car that contributed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern Munich must ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
human resources at the German football record champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also ab@@ stain from the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; the designers Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; soccer is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
hiking in the resin of star to star
&quot; in Har@@ z , Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the Association Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; meets the needs of many har@@ lot visitors . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase of the year 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables is to be completed by the internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network welcome plays a role in the selection of the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the club explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is considerably further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star will find itself and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the Berg@@ städ@@ tchen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen there are something similar to the planned star@@ base - the Plan@@ etary Trail . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the plu@@ to de@@ mot@@ ed to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the Earth is shr@@ inking on a 6.5 @-@ mil@@ lim@@ eter ball , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away and measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march to the next fixed star would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super fe@@ ather weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through a unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ di@@ visi@@ oning world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to get down to light weight .
and he has to move on weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later pressed out to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ war champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ ses to T@@ ire Pl@@ oner
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were severely injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost its control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market in front of the connector . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked towards the north for about an hour , then traffic could be passed on the left @-@ hand side of the road at the accident point . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defense information in Au@@ e scores points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , though the two ad@@ versaries would not have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two ad@@ versaries too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangle is to be further optimized . &quot;
and one goal after a free@@ way is not to catch the forums anymore .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; because we have just in the tr@@ i @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t do so many game mistakes in building up . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann too goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
&quot; at the start of the season I judge only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a thunder@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her because they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly the guests from the Rhin@@ eland will be an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s boss coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday . &quot;
new Results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age assessment tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for the app@@ rais@@ al of the correct age of some refugees , who were minor . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; propose that the signed person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of men in order to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot fail , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ correctly assessed is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in that case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Public Transportation and Transport in the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is an arch bridge made of concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly cleaned . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has got 1,@@ 30 metres wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side . &quot;
&quot; this is a border fixation , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
&quot; the special feature is that these are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented brid@@ ging caps .
special finger tip feeling has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .
&quot; in the run @-@ up to the work , the residents were informed about the project . &quot;
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be frozen first . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; are fully locked . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the three bridges amount to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole country is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ day Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; &quot; big campaign kick @-@ off clock &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the City @-@ Pic@@ nic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel has reported that he has made an effort for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was in demand at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at around 8@@ pm , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chair@@ woman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to talk about their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is time to clear up after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move - no special occur@@ ren@@ ces .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ enb@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts morning , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ji &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unites the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of N@@ ils W@@ ogram Jazz ech@@ op@@ ter mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating total artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram recorded it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart spoke openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ess ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve been making . &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d played it ?
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
I just didn &apos;t like being taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I &apos;d look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate . &quot;
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us than work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive , impressive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again in sports . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who have caught gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which start on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for res@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; funeral ceremony for soldiers , crashed in Mali &quot;
&quot; at a funeral service in northern h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two killed soldiers in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; the Minister of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the still un@@ resolved cause of the crash . &quot;
&quot; but they described the two revers@@ ing drivers as &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead watch of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the Church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them was H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the grapes were covered with roses , and the relatives were in arms in the arms of the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilot of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; in doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , the Minister of Le@@ yen pointed out that the deployment would be dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued her message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also de@@ parts the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ c@@ esses &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ crat , met in London . &quot;
&quot; at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia @-@ tobacco and which had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
there were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , on Friday , the Parliament &apos;s resolution was pronounced . &quot;
&quot; before that , the surprising outlet of a Gre@@ ens parliam@@ ent@@ arians from their state @-@ day fraction in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ city by a majority in parliament with the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ ail founded her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
&quot; as a result , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable , however , that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament plans to trust the Prime Minister and elect a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in silence , one will discuss all the questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West@@ ens step &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself emphas@@ ised : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a tra@@ itor of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their state parliament .
&quot; we , of course , assume that they have their country mandate , which they have received through the Green List , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; divided the Chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision made by El@@ ke T@@ ail . &quot;
she was deliberately decided to have no pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot follow this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxon parliam@@ ent@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Federal Executive of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens will cost the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the good of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD general secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U takes part in this dirty intri@@ gue game in Lower Saxony and tries to turn it into political capital .
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ail into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career goals . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD before the SPD , but the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in parliament . &quot;
&quot; agriculture Minister in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking and answering . &quot;
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; trade , as well as the manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are safe and harmless . &quot;
&quot; if the residual oil level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able . &quot;
&quot; un@@ polluted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few controllers in the event of emergency . &quot;
is there only a lack of staff or the cohesi@@ on competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent excluded . &quot;
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food @-@ sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot;
&quot; when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; by means of the pan@@ elled funds , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; generally , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the facts are solved quickly and without gaps . &quot;
how the football rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the executive organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) in order to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar has signed and put him in a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power of the wealthy family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to deal with legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , which had enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked trying to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take up losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoice covering the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum of € 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members remain limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income . &quot;
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar WM am@@ bass@@ adors will be am@@ bass@@ adors , and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to figure out . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Kat@@ ars &apos;s final owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair , because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced on @-@ board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the job anew .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday on request of the news agency s@@ da .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; each year , approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ els distribute to 14 grams each year before landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide information about the costs .
&quot; according to &quot; North @-@ Western Switzerland , &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but even more important is the advertising effect : for a shock absor@@ ber it is a prestigious job .
&quot; as many applicants are interested in the new tender , Swiss Life does not want to disclose . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract throughout the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Swiss company has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has built the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; &quot; The State &quot; &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the heart of the g@@ ags - actors of middle @-@ aged children are playing cool kids , who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally gro@@ unded and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point en@@ codes a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy evil plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ li@@ pp@@ ings of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise like a repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director indicates a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers of Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ bbed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ arranged to a lesser extent , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed a blow against the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office ha@@ sten@@ ed on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years old and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the case of time @-@ like ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
&quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
&quot; in total , more than 300 police officers were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of crimin@@ ality , violent acts , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in the South German region . &quot;
between the attor@@ neys in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale service was also accompanied by four local officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the investigations , Italian citizens were mainly concerned with the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the gang &apos;s account . &quot;
fashion shows large gaps in the for@@ eigner register
&quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the foreign country register . &quot;
&quot; in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; warned in an analysis carried out by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign nationality , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the data is managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany . &quot;
&quot; because the data has not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who have long ceased to be alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; however , such false orders led to a distorted debate on how to deal with the tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this results in an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this paper , it is said that BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , except infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the paper referred to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are in charge of reaching them first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the one @-@ way country . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Office has been writing : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ hand faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening human rights due to the lack in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot;
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined the mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the round@@ about leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their components . &quot;
&quot; for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house had led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded 50 % of donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their li@@ fes@@ pan . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a rein@@ forcing pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members striving to increase this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the coming years , interest increases would be necessary to brid@@ le the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package , which was issued a year after Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the next February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for cooling inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets would expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank , however , stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts , which were corrected down@@ wards for this and next year , were 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the expected results in May . &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; according to these news , the Po@@ und fell against the dollar and the euro . &quot;
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to make no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a interest rate increase , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; the in@@ comes , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the fall of the fund .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ crowded households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be put on in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in the swap rate , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing deals and fin@@ alize the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the medicine in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in the past year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England &apos;s chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of men and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants will be identified in clinics including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as used in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted specifically for needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
&quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to bringing a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment has turned into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packaged and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne closet space and a mezzanine add to the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to over@@ lay two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the award .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed over one another , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went into it , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it is very easy to slide down the door . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and an increased square meter of something by default in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real estate empire Victoria worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court in order to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the West@@ co jeans founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city area , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but accused Paul of in@@ competent to manage some of his possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ep . &quot;
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; Paul says &quot; bitter@@ ly about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has held back very well even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
new chief of staff is planning to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House which he wants to repair : poor information that gets into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with TV goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry with unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg to Politi@@ co in February . &quot;
&quot; Mr Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep the Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump Twitter habit was ever under control is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something else that we don &apos;t know to others - that Tr@@ ump twe@@ ets without their interventions have even more ignition material .
we will probably never learn about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his co @-@ workers managed to keep away from him a few times , their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons , to supply doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ciously denoun@@ ced a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy staff of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alle@@ gations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to obtain the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
&quot; in this summer , the police all over Europe sends ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals . &quot;
&quot; since the addresses of the subject of gravity are not known to nature , information from the population is hoped and requested . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the promotion , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; advent calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many refugees hide in vacation destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online companions could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate about a tren@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with a few determined travellers on the war base , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road called Soli@@ hull that is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the council to prevent their attacks . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry people have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am , since he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back now . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of those travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
&quot; in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police , calling on 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambience of the company company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13th , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the local tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council . &quot;
&quot; however , above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and already spoke of serious prospective buyers in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were demol@@ ished , ceilings were broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to be done by March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; real bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ Springs , but already on an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer points out . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already had conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , he said . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the exterior spaces are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in an inner courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia scandal : us special investig@@ ator sets up a jury of the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Panel recorded the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper has taken the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller widened and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N report reported that there were already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between the elder son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to be pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between the ump@@ ire campaign team and Moscow .
the main focus of the investigations is to stand up to several men who acted as advis@@ ers of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a closer look at the private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally moved to the center and examined the accus@@ ation whether the President could obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in potential crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the alle@@ gations .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to take part under oath .
&quot; according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his dam leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were talking to him . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , legal experts said on Thursday evening that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary . &quot;
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President of West Virginia used a speech on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the subject gives the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; feel good because they have nothing else to talk about .
&quot; his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , declared in a statement that he knew nothing about the suspension of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair way . &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it would not be determined against the President .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked for a setting up of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after presenting US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate scandal around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators proposed legislation on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the shelf . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; according to the researcher &apos;s data , the extent of climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; however , a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for about 30 years , the US Research Center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) writes in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly . &quot;
Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen is writing a complete shelf .
&quot; there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can collapse if a piece is broken at a key point . &quot;
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it does after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
&quot; there , it breaks down regularly . &quot;
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the recordings , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ shelf will grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers do not reduce the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the Antar@@ ctic ice caps are falling apart in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus en@@ umer@@ ate to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to make Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f personnel
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U demands to stand out of the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new positions in the administration have penet@@ rated 41 new jobs . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first day of work . &quot;
the teaching positions of the circle are obviously very desired .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be for@@ ked this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration aims to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know earlier .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this results in a high number of employees , who are separated from the ministry due to illness or age . &quot;
&quot; so it is time for action , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Kol@@ b , leader of the group of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was a long @-@ bloo@@ ded surprise for a long time already in the circle of circles , when he publicly questioned the personnel costs and the other parties were amazed . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be checked that permit a withdrawal from the communal employer association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county council with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the bill for the public service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exist when one changes to a higher level , which is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone for NGO @-@ migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German charity organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew effectively worked together with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart for the vessels to be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the emergency measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner Ou@@ ter Post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts for four days . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again there was a vantage point at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers have been announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome p@@ auses . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga fits for e @-@ sport
&quot; in the future , sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than going through the stadium for wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included . &quot;
&quot; the first federal li@@ ais@@ ons , which are increasingly involved in this field , have also recognised this . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed up two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that there are still a number of clubs on this train .
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
&quot; the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen , meanwhile , advises an agency for virtual soccer players . &quot;
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , it could be much more common online on these markets than to send the federal government to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; during e @-@ sports , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football @-@ simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , li@@ lies have long since established in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport in general ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certain to get used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been confronted with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which are also found in classic sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; it also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tic understanding and a quick reaction . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and look for nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , there are problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more an issue . &quot; &quot;
controls may be elu@@ sive in online games and the structures of classic sports were missing in the scene .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are internationally on the go , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to exceed 130 million . &quot;
this is not true against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , E @-@ Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
internationally many countries are already on the move .
&quot; great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe as well .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations are obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department according to D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany is la@@ gging behind Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only in football , everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal surrounding pois@@ oned eggs . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , because of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy is pushing for suicide &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced to death in June because of negligence by Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and forward @-@ looking eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; circum@@ stance she totally regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that &quot; there is no day when I am not praying the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer having the only person I have been with since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , jump from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn off the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter paid attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the event by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ worker in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain for the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern tr@@ umps the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; there was something different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide the second day of the Audi Cup was , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he simply stopped his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bayern captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the character of the coach as well .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was composed of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and straight out of the holiday . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of trust that you want to keep in your mood .
so those who have been chosen to take the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ m . &quot;
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ i worked in this start @-@ up as the one who can take the ru@@ dder best into his hand . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to direct the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe .
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folded hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches meant to get out of the performance of the Asian trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le would not fall negative in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this , after all , worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ ich , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli assault was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a couple of times successfully in the construction of the game . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that the result was &quot; not the way we have hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bayern World is still for the new arri@@ vals , one sees in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;
al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s best @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has been registered over Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bayern legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ club member of Ö@@ F@@ B captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our Lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football tournament of the year and champion League winner should be a special motivation .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dres@@ sage
&quot; it often became irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously charging the old minist@@ erial .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; bis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 will be the right to construction . &quot;
the western circum@@ navigation of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country .
&quot; the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; as von Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sack@@ ed for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the Chamber of Industry commen@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1,000 euros for the passed master test and 2500 euros is fores@@ een if graduates start independently within ten years after the master training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to employ Wis@@ sig in the state @-@ run mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce asks for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , a CD@@ U faction , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as to how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the current broad@@ band extension in the country is also sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ating internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and sits in the supervisory board of the wind force company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she already cleared the field . &quot;
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group president said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of for@@ fei@@ ting the mighty car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; shut@@ down &quot; &quot; devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in case of normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the examination could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the town wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a large raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the construction department wants to clear up .
&quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ ra @-@ saver . &quot;
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be shar@@ per as a protected wild river . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft drove across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los grow@@ n@@ up and laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most published carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the no@@ stri@@ es of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an records and works on a film . &quot;
his message : laughter because there is too much suffering in the world .
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he suggested himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; following stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came through at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his specifications , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ oping figures continue to be widely spread all over the world . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in 3D film , which is supposed to come into the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he tends to focus more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions of drought , the la@@ ven@@ der is shr@@ inking due to the conditions transmitted to drought and because of the disease , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , large headache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has implications for the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ cade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought . &quot;
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
&quot; this Saturday and Sunday , this fes@@ tivity is with a medieval festival . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and perpet@@ ual drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : enemies , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resp@@ ite of violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are pil@@ ed up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is its publisher and its inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; writes Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected to drug traffi@@ cking every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely found in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now more tra@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we di@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ca in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; twel@@ fth river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but for Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the surrender to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt because he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , assumed aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake lay in forcing Val@@ dez , following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ dd@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish harsh studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez also won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she led . &quot;
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ e@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task you are a journalist - either that or you are playing the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ dd@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine be his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ d Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ as in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who the governor itself was not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce has written three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of his brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s home town .
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , an ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , belonging to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez were regarded as the best informed source of the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is theirs .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more volumes by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and om@@ itting them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked her to be divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the paper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already over , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to h@@ um . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with steel riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ as via mobile phone . &quot;
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police who kept watch to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying one . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; uns@@ ett@@ led past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; the preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition has start@@ led researchers , which describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth l@@ umps . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bling a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ cla@@ ve , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to get better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs took head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution encouraged the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the sea ground . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland as they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with tap@@ ered fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just ke@@ el a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s on sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his dre@@ ad@@ ful ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were weighed on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cut@@ ters cover still b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ to &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it will be . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A@@ 8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilometre @-@ long rods - and g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , between the junction Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 vehicles , including truck @-@ trucks . &quot;
the exact number of injured parties does not provide any information at first .
&quot; it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesman . &quot;
a large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a round of ten kilometres was formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - with numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ gade nar@@ rated the characteristics of the car drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run operates on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer depends , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available for many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany in the early coming year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor .
&quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of booking your ticket anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like that : one climbs to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the case of the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
the train atten@@ dant with ticket control in place Y knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket .
&quot; so you can go on to sleep , work on , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which again is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , you simply check in the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing manager . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often passes by train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , one of the participants does not have all the documents required for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or otherwise a document to be presented . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of one &apos;s own ticket and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; stra@@ y Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented it and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually prayed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed by the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
&quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lively body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people crying out , and by a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman ass@@ ented his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Ferr@@ ell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance , who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Ferr@@ ell with her daughter who wore a cau@@ lif@@ lower and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot;
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past .
&quot; it must know it , and it must be seen and drawn up in it . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience ec@@ lat@@ ent racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Offic@@ ers Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Ferr@@ ell and her daughter have joined with a local owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis the President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met with Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors during an evening demonstration . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came up Ferr@@ ell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Ferr@@ ell to the project , along with six other natives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; followed in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that at this work and in the human@@ isation of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have marked the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions carried the movement overall , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the front line because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman standing so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ aster &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though it has not yet been built .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while one can say about the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; size del@@ usion ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which also the rest of the shops profit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmer market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
&quot; the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility to sit outside . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years , we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market hall . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women always happy again . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , too . &quot;
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether there is direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery - comes to the level of rent .
&quot; but this should not be very low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies because the rentals are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty stores almost no longer exist and what remains of it will also disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; first of all , where should the peasant market hall go in during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the gh@@ o@@ sts @-@ gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s simply not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping centre , which stands empty , doesn &apos;t need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many , as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served as a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after being publi@@ ci@@ zed as secret diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline used her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ national and away @-@ going dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the E@@ spi@@ on@@ age Act , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot; &quot;
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ t and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she could not be photographed at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned bl@@ ouse became too un@@ equal to Bri@@ xen , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ lement Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chel@@ lord would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy encounter . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump has led a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid spl@@ its which it should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological regards , we are all . &quot;
&quot; hopefully our gen@@ ome will not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective it is , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , how she emerges with a hands @-@ on ef@@ oot in the hand of the Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines of the United States such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they cold your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras , which gather as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at Oxford University because of killing
&quot; a nationwide chase is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot;
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several searches . &quot;
a community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the events , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively search for the two susp@@ ects said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ase , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now in absence and was excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case which is examined by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ase . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College stated in an email explaining that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them are ampli@@ fied , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip , which said that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
security cameras confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team at Grand Plaza has published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren at alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mr. Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was expelled from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing checks in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; &quot; in the right direction &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs anymore
this shared the company &apos;s groups .
&quot; it was a pure assumption that no health impairment could be assumed , it was said in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on only eggs are expected to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to be demon@@ stra@@ bly tested on the fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice receipt . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to provide clarity and transparency with his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness of your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up with your employees but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is on the look@@ out to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to offer specific groups and demographic groups , to deal with employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite leaders and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers exhibit low approval results - so that you can drill out why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance business could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the &quot; Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments &quot; financial website . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it may experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and processes and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work that you do is worth it , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies are running well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , this can dis@@ appoint dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , employees will ask , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys has been able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported .
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communications training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better engagement of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey heads and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these uns@@ af@@ e minutes constitute a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.@@ m .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys next three days , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ges @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West wood performed practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; 20 years before the beginning of formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M , September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the N@@ CA@@ A rule change , even if it adds another point to the player &apos;s busy routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they cra@@ cked on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is completed , which is not an easy task in view of the clear policies of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that has already cleared a protective grid behind a gate post . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video edge of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking place 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit warnings from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false noti@@ fications and to send them to factor sur@@ vey@@ ors , which may show results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ tive posts like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts check will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ y Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says hur@@ ting . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I just responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; alas , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) all this to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assem@@ bl@@ ets on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in dit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps depicting what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to del@@ ve into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron who hid the family Dar@@ r@@ ell for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is portrayed in the 18th century , who stages his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be Ga@@ un@@ er again and again to pay debts and spend money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell males rede@@ emed their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ locked . &quot;
&quot; after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the covering of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan hidden by Nelson Ar@@ tz . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot;
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; the makers of the promotion have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really &quot; , &quot; they write on their website un@@ folded yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we believe that as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than just &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , she is in competition with other local authorities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a medium five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the session was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five Vice @-@ Govern@@ ments as well as the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Committee also took part in the consultations . &quot;
these were the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ er of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved immediately in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating this week in Ankara . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was referred to as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Grand @-@ Pur@@ suit in the army and the security forces goes on . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan ruled by decree of another 73@@ 95 state servant , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least of his appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives specifically an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a non @-@ appointed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt to seek asylum abroad , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens are issued from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English which have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race ticket shuttle
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the race platform has been cont@@ ested - and now it is going to be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train travels can be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race ticket price in the long term , construction work will begin in the course of this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ction the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important connection for the tourism , &quot; explained transport minister Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country will take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country , is now defini@@ tively att@@ un@@ ed , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the rac@@ er @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is an especially popular railway link between the Il@@ men@@ au railway stations and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by enough people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is very steep in parts . &quot;
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it &quot;
&quot; just as you thought that it can &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of the sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
but it becomes more wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a step@@ ford woman would like to look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing to , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion web site . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , trouble one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy then ? &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something ha@@ ze and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is crossed out of the boundary @-@ zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , in relation to the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or offen@@ ding until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic pictures , the dev@@ oured body and the out @-@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
jumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a sen@@ timent of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to put our filter bags into place .
less noticed is the power b@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows them , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which they had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ appearing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that his kit@@ ten will no longer be ej@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing norm@@ alized , which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked out ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump walks , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York Parks Department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one of the major round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olog@@ ising , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was admitted to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he reported to the prison authorities in a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; due to murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death seat for murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold found a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four@@ thous@@ es of F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ lower band performed a musical titled &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens . &quot;
instead of a chicken @-@ k@@ ens a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it , sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ dd@@ les , carrying the cylinders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ four @-@ tim@@ ers to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by thanks to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps at teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she did not leave her students very reluct@@ ant , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , she was able to rely on the four @-@ door cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight first @-@ class students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illeg@@ ally tents was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have intensified the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose ; substantial fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the exhaust emissions of cars of the emissions categories Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Car Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to each person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fits be delayed altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threatened ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
&quot; up to now , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait with a sale yet .

we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker City Buil@@ der has been a master builder . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press interview .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application fulfil@@ s the requirements profile so far . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , under consideration of the regular notice periods , there is still enough time for a famili@@ arization . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a lower building authority authority , the applicant has to demonstrate appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ ven parking place are about to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium restoration is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will beat around 1.5 million euros , &quot; If we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is a great room for a city building master . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexibly . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often men@@ tion@@ ned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban construction master emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister also bears a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; according to the city of Has@@ lach , anyone who wants to bury Roland W@@ acker should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building design and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to civil engineering and civil engineering , building guidelines , property management , municipal property management , building yard and urban gardening , as well as the Lower Building Rights Authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bike thrown on lines : South railway locked locked
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night .
near the crime scene there were witnessed by witnesses a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; that goes far beyond a level of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have brought himself into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay in the delay and the costs for rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , there was a &quot; substantial &quot; sum out , said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be managed without obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten people had fallen out on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food are not penet@@ rating into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging delicate tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found to show that a kind of tolerance induc@@ ing immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their ent@@ rails .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an nutrition tolerant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han often promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system is also involved in people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe which was separated but separated . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i normally living in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacteria species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were removed in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid grow and then carried small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. Cross protect us in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes in Manchester United after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; matic , however , was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asian tour of the blues and only made 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four primary obligations . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association for that , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington in Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and one minute .
&quot; on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be . &quot;
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; so the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked at Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no stor@@ my from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - this was the most important wish of the bal@@ lot fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundamental change has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter @-@ wind . &quot;
there were deep hits .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens Euro MP in a heavy crisis .
&quot; five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition was thus losing its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German Chief Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ ail to give back her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ail must immediately give back her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the German Chief Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ er si@@ ghs when the new job &apos;s message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the over@@ step of the green de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
it is the preliminary peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the unexpectedly clear defeat of the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , not more , the comrades reas@@ sured at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was , and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a rush , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after , comrades , the comrades ra@@ ced again and again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just given up new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit arrived from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD landing head , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communications he did everything wrong about what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now . &quot;
the survey results were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden by comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , since they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in essence no guilt . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; in the meantime , comrades , therefore , endeav@@ our to keep its own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; her anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the back@@ sliding Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ jackets puts her own career decisions on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but by the country list of Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxon MP continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary fraction , compla@@ ins of &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ v@@ res . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters have been clear four years ago : people made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ di@@ ates the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called on to clarify the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local core III
&quot; who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg City development took place on Wednesday in emotion . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , it has been in sensitive renovation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was EUR 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 , of which 500 000 euro would come from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area arise ?
&quot; one will further investigate , so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .
&quot; if necessary , the area limits could then shift again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
&quot; finally , the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; the grants for funding for funding have been running since 1 January 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however until September this year , however , the survey will only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , it is planned to take place as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every commun@@ e had to carry out the preliminary investigations .
the aim is to evaluate and decide when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective property , there will also be a renovation project in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , once again , will come to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and to be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; where it works , among other things , the structural condition and renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and residential arc , &quot; information on size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be noted that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , restructuring measures are not eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; function - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot;
you cannot reserve funding for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the project , photos of the project &quot; Local History II &quot; were shown to make the visitors feel &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British inventor puts himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising expenses of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
&quot; the White House decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that has highlighted the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military given to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was issued by a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire engine and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the flight departure from the White House is delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original air crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was needed . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal government to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation when the Pres@@ i@@ dency was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential vehicle by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead to training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area , in order to reduce the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ed records for the Pres@@ i@@ dency flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund set for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
record of unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
the runner @-@ up of the second Tennis League ki@@ cks off at the Tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss takes place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis League has gained a sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ enti@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good dose of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; the Fren@@ ch@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) , is currently making the first use of this season at the Chall@@ enger @-@ Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo , yesterday , was at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; he should be in Kiel , but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the Club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also move back to the team . &quot;
&quot; for the 18 year old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , it is not enough to fill the cad@@ res out of the coaching staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the Congress gave a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the O@@ MV , together with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed with the construction of the Russian East Coast North Stream 2 . &quot;
the threat of dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; viewed which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him .
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be put into the center of the series by Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the three and four seasons were confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 Company with more governmental bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry C@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1 September .
role in reverse : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is revers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s day care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Assistant Head of the Department of Youth Wel@@ fare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the town operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last kit@@ ten year there were 2,@@ 800 children at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 2@@ pm .
&quot; 46 sub @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the cooked meals , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , serving the meal individually , fill out the meal , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een @-@ group facilities - decides over the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy food and cooking classes .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is expe@@ dient .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in comparison to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , which it has turned out to be the most economical solution for the city . &quot;
&quot; and that , though 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not as strong at around 750 persons in the education area , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled to the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban have released threats against an election process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , elections will be handed over for the first time peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

&quot; according to the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who sat with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 5@@ pm , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glas@@ gow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has out@@ weighed the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies in addition to other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; experience the first if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s head office , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we are not able to gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of workplaces , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently needed for a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; one of the speakers from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the leader of T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland just yesterday , and the company will react immediately as we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e business climate , we continuously check our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we fully appreciate the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La Liga may have regre@@ t@@ ted her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , and the Spanish society expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to tear off under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has intentionally revers@@ ed a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle was caused by excess of more than 200 euros . &quot;

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the crash barriers . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um , with his VW , arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him on his lane , so that he had to leave to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the crash barriers . &quot;
&quot; in the car , material damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident @-@ damaged person , it can be good that the cycl@@ ist driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
the police are now asking witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on Tel 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the late Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that during the reporting on violence in the cats &quot; cats , &quot; two measures &quot; would be measured . &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would be punished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was conspic@@ uous , such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion of keeping it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ par@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a bon@@ ded fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a very normal pedago@@ gical remedy &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; to be finished with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann attributed to R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he uses the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer Ulrich Weber has submitted to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment at the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were subjected to &quot; high plau@@ sibility &quot; between 1945 and the early 1990s , when 67 domain cats were sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; even with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more intense . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence in the protection of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz did not produce top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all . &quot;
&quot; for him , eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have taken the first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , presents a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood erup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop with chairs and threw the key down on the floor , but also distributed ear @-@ cow@@ ards and moved too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he has given himself already years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widely used in the time of the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced it in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
one wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media over@@ threw him .
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the media reports a lot about mis@@ use among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also put some involvement or co @-@ wis@@ s with regard to sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : distinc@@ tly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the people , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of the use of mis@@ use ?
Michael hes@@ emann says : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... not a case in which he would have had a timely insight ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that it was imp@@ uted to him ... to have opened bu@@ ben more in@@ sist@@ ently or clearer or more rather than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the pupils and / or their surroundings had been entrusted to him in the run @-@ up , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free from any co @-@ founder . &quot;
he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an adver@@ t .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link its good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of having &quot; Look away &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; but this , in turn , is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and portrayed , and suffered tremend@@ ously , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the cathedral school gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : indeed , there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; many victims loved the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the repro@@ ach remains to be looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently give ear to the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral of the cathedral , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out , &quot; &quot; that the punishment will continue to be practiced in the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as a criminal record had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate also for him , where the victims were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been crossed . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger of evaluating the past according to contemporary moral standards . &quot;
the princess was right .
&quot; but of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what was ban@@ ished in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally work .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ear@@ nest and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
what picture of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger read in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject of the test sentence also come to speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI@@ . , tells of his perspective , that the cathedral cats played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t mean that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ class , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and candy only one does not even make a big singer and before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , ground @-@ good , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get to see how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ority , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cats are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them closer to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to whom today they still look up and which they almost rever@@ e . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly : all that you acc@@ use to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the an@@ archy would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to settle in peace . &quot;
