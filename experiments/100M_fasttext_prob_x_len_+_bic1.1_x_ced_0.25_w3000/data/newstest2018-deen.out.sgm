<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former land of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-Navi instead of a change road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-atlases, an offer of Geoport as Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called" "judgements" "were incorporated for towns and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian" "survey management" "between 1810 and 1864, they originate from the first survey of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the award for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendlinger was 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called" "Urge", "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots are now no longer occupied by farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the position sheet, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "on the Gasteig" "or from the" "View on the Ventilation" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle Irrenberg" "Auf der Auer Lünen" "was built there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought to the king Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the buying of the so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"there was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor rennet in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich suburb of Salesianum now meet in the area of the former Auer prison.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenberg, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "Main Square" "around 1856, the shopping cart was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also had a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for Missouri State, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, urges afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to get special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of dubious, racist incidents have recently occurred throughout the country and be noted here," "says the Group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state, which are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to publish the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries to citizens' rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will stop because of their skin colour, they will be smashed or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Missouri General Public Prosecutor, which shows that black motorists are 75 percent more common in the state than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring in deposit money or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidefence Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-wing cemetery of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the Fisherman's CDU-Location Association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates in five apartments Feriengaste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest milk "is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows," says Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste there is only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the electric fence project as" elementary "important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot must be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead to bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader-promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the planting of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation," the mayor stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in critique because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced using the electric fence support."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the surface area is 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested by at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs of €71 500 were promoted over leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of fences," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac said:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landladies it's not going."</seg>
<seg id="90">"for Peter Weiss also stood firm:" "here, best food is produced." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Research Directive (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables the state-of-the-art funding of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a sponsorship marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the protracted area must not be deflected (slope for 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fischerbacher Hof electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty"</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of the president for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty insulators would have smiled him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took on its significance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta said," "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you relate that was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it's about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your tired, your poor, / your crowded masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable rubbish of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elding waste" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base knew very well that they took a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to switch it back from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty invades no one, but rather an early neoconservative, who brings the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"rather unusual, Limbaugh came across something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them in such a way as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not light the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembered a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the UK's Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which started on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland has developed something special" and the UK's athletics has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the corner of the street.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to a team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling, which Eilidh naturally brought in, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships at 400 m hurdles, says it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir goes on this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which is to be observed after a great season, which was included in the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be mixed with medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose it makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't get a public office if you cannot tolerate the empowering of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked at criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said," "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep for slaughter." ""</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of doing so at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with its voters and to debug his hairy head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, is considered to be official and of employees paid by public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson attorney Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor, arguing that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasserfilled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not full of water, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news posting "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor's staff referred to as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guides or to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judges James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable porto had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were suggested by his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">True guidance means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="425">"Musk now admits: from the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 had already been withdrawn."</seg>

<seg id="450">"in former administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job. "</seg>
<seg id="451">"we do not believe in a regulation through judicial procedures, and we take deadlines seriously."</seg>
<seg id="452">We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously.</seg>
<seg id="453">"nevertheless, the EPA statement said that Pruitt will eventually use its" power to delay and all other legally available authority "to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July, is invited to a serenade at 4.30pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tumarc their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"Walter Martini emphasizes:" "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer original customer book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, apart from the former parish church, there was also a wonderful courtyard, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not the other way around."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the" "Berg" "is the third, the magnificent settling centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are subject to these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was born from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman, who built a church and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in doing so, the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), window panes were inserted and the bell rings were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops were encamped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the Church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tummy Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church steeple was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">"only the tower, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history."</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Washer maintain the Hilarius system as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organiser, the friends and supporters of Tumarc invite on Sunday, 16th July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local rector Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"for the serenade of the Serenade, a trunk is held in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers set out fantastic views. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of importance for tumors and listeners."</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim restrained itself" "does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Council."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the" "Boisheim" "association has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">"such zones are intended to prevent" "sparing" "of the landscape."</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, but it did not approve the district government of Dusseldorf because of a mould failure."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planned legal requirements, the granted approval requirement is still unlawful and therefore to be reduced," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"in view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed the lease agreements with the owner of the area around 65 hectares."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-rail households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, four-sens town council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year old congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the post-ordination function serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected."</seg>

<seg id="599">"as it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report. "</seg>

<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the lynching because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done.</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors pressed - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and listened as a Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece."</seg>

<seg id="617">The fire is reciprocated by Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>

<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>

<seg id="640">"they all experienced Georgias oppressive moisture almost eight hours, when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys."</seg>
<seg id="641">"up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, when one stands in the same country where the Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels scary."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the songs sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," "he murmured a little boy, as if he wanted to remember."</seg>

<seg id="657">"in the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds yard at his table, he eats and remembers the citizen's rights."</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he started to plan the performance next year.</seg>

<seg id="748">"in the end, the decision was clear: with two counterparts, the Municipal Council decides to establish a common room in the future retirement home."</seg>
<seg id="749">"before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing land section is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden."</seg>
<seg id="750">"although it will take some time for the area belonging to the church community to date, there is no planning obstacle for the project to be bridged by a private investor."</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room for this.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a space of 70 square meters for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are suspended, such a common area is not intended to be a meeting point for the inhabitants of seniorenequitable living, but openly in the congregation."</seg>

<seg id="762">It is not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"Daniela's call points to the many of his own buildings, with which one does not proceed as well, but now I lean into the common room out of the window, she says:" "I do not do so with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger unconditionally speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus, but a real, in doubt a marketable counter-value, the counter-speech is."</seg>

<seg id="862">"with the first season of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, though the two adversaries would not have been at the 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two adversaries too much, and we have to watch out better in Aue," says the defense player from Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the triangle is to be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">And one goal after a freeway is not to catch the forums anymore.</seg>

<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how we will act in Aue," "says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing," "because we have just in the tri-chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are even better harmonizing and we don't do so many game mistakes in building up."</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know about 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the Minister of the Interior of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">Admittedly the guests from the Rhineland will be an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away, just because we have the right to come under the first six is nonsense," "says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games."</seg>

<seg id="884">"the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum process, they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for the appraisal of the correct age of some refugees, who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person" may be under 18 years old. ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>

<seg id="895">"when the paper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year."</seg>

<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used."</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we cannot fail, we should not do as if we could," he said to the newspaper Metro. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the executive organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) in order to buy the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar has signed and put him in a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power of the wealthy family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to deal with legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, which had enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked trying to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take up losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"despite the fact that Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the invoice covering the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum of €44.4 million in the financial statements can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of €60 million (back then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members remain limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>

<seg id="1159">"in recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss."</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time is scarce.</seg>

<seg id="1206">"there are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who was rearranged to a lesser extent, could better deliver his Agitprop-Satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police managed a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Public Prosecutor's Office hastened on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1213">"in doing so, 15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years old and already issued arrest warrants against them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros."</seg>

<seg id="1232">"according to this, the data is managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforcing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with less members striving to increase this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalized that in the coming years, interest increases would be necessary to bridle the inflation of Brexit and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package, which was issued a year after Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the next February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" "in the central prognosis of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for cooling inflation and a" slightly larger "scale than the markets would expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"the Bank, however, stressed that increases would be" "progressively" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">"the Bank's growth forecasts, which were corrected downwards for this and next year, were 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the expected results in May."</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">"according to these news, the Pound fell against the dollar and the euro."</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to make no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of a interest rate increase, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to lie at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is easy to recover after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salaries, as the tightening is getting worse before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot" "prevent" "the incomes, but she added that wages will be" "clear" "at the end of their three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to weak pounds, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the fall of the fund.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-crowded households, with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation dropped from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and will be put on in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2% was "quite" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline in the swap rate, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the medicine in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in the past year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England's chief Simon Stevens as an" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as" "decisive moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of men and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"suitable participants will be identified in clinics including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt-in for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as used in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted specifically for needy and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"we sincerely welcome this announcement." ""</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to bringing a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks this little Earls Court apartment has turned into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packaged and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne closet space and a mezzanine add to the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to overlay two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over one another, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so it is very easy to slide down the door."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>

<seg id="1355">Brothers struggling for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate empire Victoria worth over 500 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton football club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court in order to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco jeans founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city area, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin is described by Paul as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin's property has a value of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accused Paul of incompetent to manage some of his possessions."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the family's first jeep."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark had paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark are," Paul says "bitterly about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has held back very well even though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin replied by SMS to say" "I can't say much," "because the case is in front of the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father didn't want Paul and me to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hope for a solution." "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," "Colin wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1388">New chief of staff is planning to restrict the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House which he wants to repair: poor information that gets into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with TV goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to be persuaded," "said former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Mr Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep the Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump Twitter habit was ever under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something else that we don't know to others - that Trump tweets without their interventions have even more ignition material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his co-workers managed to keep away from him a few times, their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers, the president for strategic reasons, to supply doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously denounced a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staff of staff Katie Walsh," being the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter due to chicanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to obtain the trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1428">"some of the wealthiest landlords of the West Midlands are back with a few determined travellers on the war base, who have negotiated a trench drawn by the municipality to reclaim a field in front of their mansions."</seg>
<seg id="1429">Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a well-to-do road called Solihull that is called the "Millionaire series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their attacks."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry people have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must be forced into action by Scham, since he was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"the travellers were there in May, moved on and are back now."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more came last night, probably even more today."</seg>
<seg id="1437">"she added:" "the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks."</seg>
<seg id="1438">"I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge, if the Council cannot stop it."</seg>
<seg id="1439">"a local people who didn't want to be called said:" "it's ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of those travelers, only to be plundered by another round."</seg>
<seg id="1440">The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">A spokeswoman of Solihull said: "we are aware of an unauthorised camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">"in order to support our evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible call an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police, calling on 101."</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made up of the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambience of the company company ltd. on April 13th, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the local tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and already spoke of serious prospective buyers in the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction shuttles have been in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were demolished, ceilings were broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to be done by March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should become" "real bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in LauterSprings, but already on an elevated downtown level, Scherer points out."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already had conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, he said."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he calculates."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior spaces are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in an inner courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia scandal: us special investigator sets up a jury of the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the Panel recorded the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper has taken the step as a sign that Mueller widened and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN report reported that there were already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between the elder son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to be purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between the umpire campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The main focus of the investigations is to stand up to several men who acted as advisers of the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took a closer look at the private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump personally moved to the center and examined the accusation whether the President could obstruct the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in potential crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite people to take part under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr. also Trump consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his dam leader Paul Manafort, were talking to him."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening, legal experts said on Thursday evening that the introduction shows that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President of West Virginia used a speech on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor, Ty Cobb, declared in a statement that he knew nothing about the suspension of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this work usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair way."</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rationale, accusations against Trump have become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump asked for a setting up of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after presenting US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress such as the Watergate scandal around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed legislation on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to the researcher's data, the extent of climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelven.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">"as a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this ice shelf, the balance of waxes and abort was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen is writing a complete shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is some evidence that the Larsen-C shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can collapse if a piece is broken at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it does after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelven is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"there, it breaks down regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelshelf will grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers do not reduce the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic ice caps are falling apart in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus enumerate to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a" "competition of public employers." ""</seg>

<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Kolb, leader of the group of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he was a long-blooded surprise for a long time already in the circle of circles, when he publicly questioned the personnel costs and the other parties were amazed."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked that permit a withdrawal from the communal employer association.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone for NGO-migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German charity organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew effectively worked together with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that its crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart for the vessels to be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel Prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the emergency measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day there went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again there was a vantage point at the lookout spot, connected by" flew "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters have been announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome pauses."</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga fits for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in the future, sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than going through the stadium for wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gaits included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"the first federal liaisons, which are increasingly involved in this field, have also recognised this."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"at the beginning of 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed up two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certain that there are still a number of clubs on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">"the ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen, meanwhile, advises an agency for virtual soccer players."</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-athletes under contract, it could be much more common online on these markets than to send the federal government to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"during e-sports, computer games such as" League of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football-simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, lilies have long since established in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport in general?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certain to get used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has long been confronted with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses, which are also found in classic sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactic understanding and a quick reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and look for nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, there are problems:" doping becomes more and more an issue. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls may be elusive in online games and the structures of classic sports were missing in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are internationally on the go, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth ahead of the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to exceed 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is not true against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, E-Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultant. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Internationally many countries are already on the move.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports competitions Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot to do in Europe as well.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the Bundesliga-associations are obliged to set up an e-sports department according to Dutt."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany is lagging behind Germany," explains VfB Management Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to decay only in nostalgia, and to clear the old times, is no longer sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time in the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitalized world," says Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced to death in June because of negligence by Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">"the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday:" "my family is inconsolable."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and forward-looking eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any repentance." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible" "circumstance she totally regretted."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, saying that" there is no day when I am not praying the loss of my beloved Son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was" "persecuted" "by the realization that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer having the only person I have been with since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, jump from a building, arise yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," "she said in several news, which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "Everything you have to do is turn off the generator, and you will be free and happy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter paid attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the event by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British co-worker in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimich: learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">The fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain for the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">FC Bayern trumps the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"there was something different on his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimi saw immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide the second day of the Audi Cup was, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he simply stopped his arm."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the trainer did not announce it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first deployment as a Bayern captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the stand could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimi was able to interpret the character of the coach as well.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, which was composed of youth players, debutants and straight out of the holiday."</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of trust that you want to keep in your mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">So those who have been chosen to take the heritage of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">"Kimi confirmed:" "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old flattened the field as a mini-lamm."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"on the right-hand side, this is his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kimi worked in this start-up as the one who can take the rudder best into his hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions and tried to direct the uncoordinated troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the view for the whole, while many others were busy with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus, to overplay his missing fitness (folded hardly); Renato Sanches meant to get out of the performance of the Asian trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle would not fall negative in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"this, after all, worked very well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran beside Kimich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli assault was often difficult, and Süle also tried a couple of times successfully in the construction of the game."</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy stated that the result was "not the way we have hoped for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a decent performance in the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"game relocation, tempo change:" for this style, I was also fetched. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"how unusual this Bayern World is still for the new arrivals, one sees in connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Rudy, for example, was not one or two in the catacombs, but for six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi said goodbye to a few crunchy statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard of Süle an interesting sentence:" "what is going on here, I already noticed."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it often became irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously charging the old ministerial.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says:" "bissing attacks the wishes of the economy that has blocked Lemke all."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest turnaround sees natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021 will be the right to construction."</seg>
<seg id="1732">The western circumnavigation of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministerial spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees this as a sign for supporting regional, but internationally competing companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"as von Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sacked for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1743">"Christian Baldauf, a CDU faction, refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a concept of the country as to how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"furthermore, the current broadband extension in the country is also sobering."</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"but nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutralizing the exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of forfeiting the mighty car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called" "shutdown" "devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in case of normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1762">"the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought in court in the United States."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">"the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to drought."</seg>
<seg id="1806">The little town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200-year anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="1807">"this Saturday and Sunday, this festivity is with a medieval festival."</seg>
<seg id="1808">"dealers, guilds, dealers, vagants or a country camp should be in the city centre on these days."</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and perpetual drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: enemies, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no respite of violence, and while the corpses are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is its publisher and its inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," writes Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders connected to drug trafficking every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely found in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now more traitors."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we distrust everybody."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodocica in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "twelfth river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but for Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the surrender to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt because he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have angered the sons, assumed aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake lay in forcing Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riddce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish harsh studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez also won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Romeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task you are a journalist - either that or you are playing the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riddce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love for the routine be his ruin?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the publisher of the Riodocid Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodocias in a four-storey building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen, who the governor itself was not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodocice has written three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of his brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to government spending concentrated on the Governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, an abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers of Valdez were regarded as the best informed source of the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become more volumes by writing in organized protests" "SOS Press" "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and omitting them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked her to be divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border-state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the paper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue how El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already over, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their telephones began to hum."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with steel rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan beach had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the curb edge, they have published the news on the website of Riodocias via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The cover page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heulten nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police who kept watch to see if they were ready.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," "said Bojorquez," "if on the same day when Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a "unsettled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described him as" the preserved armoured dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. ""</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurs, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well-preserved condition has startled researchers, which describe it as" "really remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth lumps."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembling a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterclave, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to get better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs took headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been the chalk-time," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea ground."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland as they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaur is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with tapered flaky skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just keel a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it's on sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs were hunted by some of his dreadful ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the preserved armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were weighed on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutters cover still bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a win in the lotto '."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it will be."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: mass arambolage to A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous injured, kilometre-long rods - and gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"according to the first data of the police, between the junction Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) were almost 30 vehicles, including truck-trucks."</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of injured parties does not provide any information at first.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of Munich, a round of ten kilometres was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as an AZ reporter reports, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive disabilities - with numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire brigade narrated the characteristics of the car drivers, which now have to be reckoned with delicate penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you sit in the train and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffalo.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor comes and wakes an unsuspected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test run operates on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer depends, we expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available for many other long-haul routes in Germany in the early coming year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the ticket devaluation without a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to be able to use them, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to buy it via the train, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking your ticket anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" Comfort check-in "works like that: one climbs to the train, calls his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"in the case of the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">The train attendant with ticket control in place Y knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can go on to sleep, work on, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which again is to use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without ticket inspection by our train attendant, you simply check in the DB navigator yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing manager. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often passes by train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times, however, one of the participants does not have all the documents required for devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the identity card is missing, or otherwise a document to be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of one's own ticket and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2018">Additional numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"how an activist came to learn the answer to the question:" "stray Streets?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that rented it and scrolled through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a mail from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the road," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody else posted the information on their feed, they closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continually prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of Browns's lively body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people crying out, and by a man claiming to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assented his rifle and cried," I will kill you... animals all kill. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance, who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who wore a cauliflower and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she recalled what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it with me," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it must know it, and it must be seen and drawn up in it."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience eclatent racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officers Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis the President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors during an evening demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came up Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell to the project, along with six other natives, the team of" Whose Streets "followed in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement" is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that at this work and in the humanisation of black people there must be a certain vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have marked the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmativer type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the front line because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman standing so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory, since she went to Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomaster": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though it has not yet been built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one can say about the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a human "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" size delusion! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which also the rest of the shops profit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmer market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz, with the possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Room:" for many years, we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer's market hall. "</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether there is direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery - comes to the level of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"but this should not be very low for the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies because the rentals are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty stores almost no longer exist and what remains of it will also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"first of all, where should the peasant market hall go in during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghosts-gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's simply not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping centre, which stands empty, doesn't need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many, as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst served as a 35-year custodial sentence after being publicized as secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline used her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transnational and away-going dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning was obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she could not be photographed at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned blouse became too unequal to Brixen, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" Supplement Images, "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President of Chellord would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy encounter."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump has led a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid splits which it should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture. ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological regards, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"hopefully our genome will not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective it is," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, how she emerges with a hands-on efoot in the hand of the Disciplines of the United States such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they cold your speech, they have won," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacras, which gather as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a nationwide chase is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are looking for suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several searches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the events, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police actively search for the two suspects said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>

<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A speaker from the University and Somerville College stated in an email explaining that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are amplified," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said, the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip, which said that something had happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren at alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports."</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the brood postponed the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in West wood performed practical exercises."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent, and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaiy Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'covers the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2301">"alas, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") all this to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assemblets on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in ditches."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" "Whiskey" "and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought that an uprising was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit patron who hid the family Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed in the 18th century, who stages his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was dug)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be Gauner again and again to pay debts and spend money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell males redeemed their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landlocked."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of its use in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences"</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan ruled by decree of another 7395 state servant, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the masters of the country earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least of his appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2388">"the rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it"</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that it can't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of the sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "customize" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that a stepford woman would like to look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing to, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" who conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible," enthuses the True Companion web site. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means: reluctant) Farrah, trouble one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy then?"</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing refinement point to something haze and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is crossed out of the boundary-zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, in relation to the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offending until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic pictures, the devoured body and the out-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and completely on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disappearing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we talk about" "normalization" "and trump, we refer to the spooky way that his kitten will no longer be ejected."</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">Overview of the most important questions and answers.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW-Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are intended to improve the exhaust emissions of cars of the emissions categories Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin of ACE Car Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action compulsory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">"no, software updates are voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have the Schuman Software," "says Anja Smetanin."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Bundesamt (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">"manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months, but not yet called an exact date."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has communicated to each person affected.</seg>
<seg id="2505">"if an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within the framework."</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long should the retrofits be delayed altogether?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2508">It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen, voluntary dealerships do not act on the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">It could be time-consuming to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">"what do drivers, who do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?"</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE advises to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"probably foreign manufacturers would follow, so Smetanin."</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is a massive price fall of Euro-4 cars now threatened?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE is afraid of that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2519">"up to now, there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas."</seg>

<seg id="2527">The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">"traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania at the ceremony."</seg>
<seg id="2529">The prize-winner Lear announced with progressive TV shows has already announced that he will not be able to attend the gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">"the New York Times said:" "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that burdened me."</seg>

<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, is going to retire next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place is already written out - however, suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker City Builder has been a master builder."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press interview.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports from varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that no application fulfils the requirements profile so far."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, under consideration of the regular notice periods, there is still enough time for a familiarization."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as a lower building authority authority, the applicant has to demonstrate appropriate degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would not be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in ministry, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla Areas and the Niederhoven parking place are about to be initiated."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and stadium restoration is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will beat around 1.5 million euros," If we do it right, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is a great room for a city building master."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own yard and gardener, many things can be reacted quite flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentionned by citizens and visitors."</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what fits in, "if new buildings are approved, the outgoing urban construction master emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister also bears a high level of responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," "in the end everything runs over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wants:" "we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"according to the city of Haslach, anyone who wants to bury Roland Wacker should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building design and construction planning law."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Stadtbauamt is subject to civil engineering and civil engineering, building guidelines, property management, municipal property management, building yard and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Rights Authority, including monument protection."</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike thrown on lines: South railway locked locked</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and have been looking for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the crime scene there were witnessed by witnesses a rosy scooter and a bicycle driver.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that goes far beyond a level of Lausanne," "said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA."</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrator, or the perpetrators, would have brought himself into great danger and jeopardized the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay in the delay and the costs for rail transport, Pönalen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, there was a" substantial "sum out, said the speaker."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway line could be managed without obstructions."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"nearly ten people had fallen out on Friday morning, two of them concerned the long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall, but they were late."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food are not penetrating into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging delicate tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to show that a kind of tolerance inducing immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their entrails.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an nutrition tolerant to tryptophan often promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system is also involved in people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe which was separated but separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi normally living in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacteria species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were removed in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri in a liquid grow and then carried small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was purified, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. Cross protect us in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"in the presence of L. reuteri, high tryptophan values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described in the approach with counter-wind."</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were deep hits.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one by one.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red-green can simply not rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) overthrew the surprising fraction of a Greens Euro MP in a heavy crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the election, his red-green coalition was thus losing its one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-German Chief Executive Officer Michael Kellner called on the backsliding Lower Saxony Green Party member Elke Tail to give back her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electorate's will.</seg>

<seg id="2637">"this must not be true," an SPD election campaiger sighs when the new job's message reaches the party centre on Friday morning. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without his own government majority following the overstep of the green deputies."</seg>

<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communications he did everything wrong about what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now."</seg>
<seg id="2654">The survey results were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for this reason, Weil tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks."</seg>

<seg id="2664">"Ms. Tvest has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but by the country list of Lower Saxony's Greens, so the Lower Saxon MP continues."</seg>

<seg id="2673">"in addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives Steg City development took place on Wednesday in emotion."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"at the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"since 1991, it has been in sensitive renovation areas."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was at least 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous renovations are a" achievement project "- it is finally important to promote internal development, and not only to open up new construction areas."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount was EUR 833 333, of which 500 000 euro would come from the country, the rest of the community."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a rehabilitation area arise?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will further investigate, so Schindler, where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the area limits could then shift again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme" "Social City", "where the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"finally, the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a statute."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"the grants for funding for funding have been running since 1 January 2017 until April 30, 2026."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"however until September this year, however, the survey will only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, it is planned to take place as soon as possible, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every commune had to carry out the preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to evaluate and decide when it is rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective property, there will also be a renovation project in the land register."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann, once again, will come to sensations and get a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and to be filled up until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and property sheet", "where it works, among other things, the structural condition and renovation views."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the gray questionnaire, the" household and residential arc, "information on size, division and residents of a residential area can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "arc" "can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, it must be noted that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, restructuring measures are not eligible for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the" "greyhound principle" "function - who comes first, admonishes first."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that has highlighted the American manufacturing last month, costs taxpayers according to the military given to TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued by a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy commander for aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the flight departure from the White House is delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original air crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was needed."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform, which was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter to the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budgeted records for the Presidency flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>

<seg id="2745">Record of unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America this week," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>

<seg id="2804">"the town operates in the Krefeld area 46 daycare centers, in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"last kitten year there were 2,800 children at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat in the Kita at noon," explains Pommeranz. "</seg>

<seg id="2808">"46 sub-time employees have kitchen service from 1 September: they heat up the cooked meals, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, serving the meal individually, fill out the meal, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen."</seg>

<seg id="2813">That's why it's all about eating healthy food and cooking classes.</seg>

<seg id="2887">The police are now asking witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau on Tel 05761 / 92060.</seg>
<seg id="2888">"interview:" "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger" ""</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses is relieved by Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the late Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that during the reporting on violence in the cats" cats, "two measures" would be measured. "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is" shameful and shameful deeds "that would be punished and prevented in the future; but the" degree of media manipulation "was conspicuous, such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion of keeping it normal," writes Scarparia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "we like to go to the church and this is a bonded fresco." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a very normal pedagogical remedy", "" "to be finished with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann attributed to Ratzinger the memory band" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he uses the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly stands in the 440-page report, which the lawyer Ulrich Weber has submitted to the Enlightenment at the Bistum Regensburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were subjected to" high plausibility "between 1945 and the early 1990s, when 67 domain cats were sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other defendants, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence in the protection of the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became tangible when a Domspatz did not produce top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for him, eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool were also expropriated outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him, learn from it too late or have taken the first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, presents a very excellent testimony," "sincere", "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent, "and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to flood eruptions."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he didn't just pop with chairs and threw the key down on the floor, but also distributed ear-cowards and moved too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he has given himself already years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it must be said, however, that such educational methods were widely used in the time of the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced it in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"in comparison with what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are certainly bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media overthrew him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the media reports a lot about misuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger will also put some involvement or co-wiss with regard to sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: distinctly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of the people," "It was very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in educating sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of the use of misuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael hesemann says: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... not a case in which he would have had a timely insight (Georg Ratzinger) and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that it was imputed to him... to have opened buben more insistently or clearer or more rather than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report on the very clear result:" "that the pupils and / or their surroundings had been entrusted to him in the run-up, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any co-founder."</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link its good name to these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was a lot of" "violent excesses" "at the Regensburg Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of having "Look away" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but this, in turn, is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and portrayed, and suffered tremendously, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions had to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the cathedral school gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the theme" "primary school" "is taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael hesemann: indeed, there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" many victims loved the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the reproach remains to be looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently give ear to the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral of the cathedral, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out," "that the punishment will continue to be practiced in the preschool." ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as a criminal record had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate also for him, where the victims were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been crossed."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "snare of anachronism", "thus the danger of evaluating the past according to contemporary moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times and not for what was banished in the preschool of resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. earnest and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger read in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of the test sentence also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, that the cathedral cats played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't mean that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy only one does not even make a big singer and before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, ground-good, deeply believing and heart-good people, from whom you can't imagine that he could do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get to see how many former Domspatzen still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his emeriority, visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cats are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to whom today they still look up and which they almost revere."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once more clearly: all that you accuse to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the anarchy would command a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to settle in peace."</seg>
