28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping mall .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother testified that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided into San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; to combine his way with his family was to make us cook for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD as number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always plu@@ gged into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or getting stuck out of the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress loves to spend their time at home , in front of TV with local de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of change with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career ended again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he let himself run with his family on the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even shoot for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was absolutely convincing .
&quot; the German sport aid handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala , the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid . &quot;
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th award winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it will not only be awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master si@@ eger was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winners are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gym@@ n@@ ast of Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the champion Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ ball of Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the lava price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and b@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US Pres@@ i@@ dency applicants are un@@ divided in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will drive regulations drastically , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has opportunities to open and need money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost exactly the same . &quot;
the democratic candidate is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; thus , there could still be internal discussions on Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energy with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , the trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , both the USA do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , says Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , &quot; &quot; The minimum wage must rise , then he says he cannot be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months will probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics say to him , that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at most one year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the setup together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich @-@ based Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience of sexual violence in her escape , &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not know how to help , they need more accommodations just for them , called B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
some answers to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their competence area .
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors in some common shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accomod@@ ations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or are housed together men and women , it may be - perpet@@ ually - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much women feel this need for protection can be read at the And@@ ine , which is available at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; we have been waiting around for a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot;
you could easily find a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
the deputy of the assistance doctors called on their union to approve new combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
&quot; from the beginning of September , the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for more labour action . &quot;
the J@@ DC said that ministers had given orders to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have had problems , which led to the refusal of the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board of Management has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating labour action measures commen@@ ced at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors went six times this year , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of BM@@ A resident physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced forci@@ bly . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow@@ ly and he hardly had any warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as though he had never done anything bad .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating and sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing which he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into Russia &apos;s back .
going down was even bigger as it was committed by an alleged friend .
building up the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria being controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get , after he has been reli@@ eved of his death in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports were allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti phr@@ ased it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the continuing gru@@ dge on the s@@ nail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relation to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; as an analy@@ st : two countries that feel viol@@ ated from the West and feel ill @-@ treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently acted as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they hadn &apos;t even touched the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State will speak at least once more . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for clients outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &apos; R@@ BS &apos; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Win@@ ner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus on more national brands .
&quot; Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange service to Nat@@ al are changed . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue a global goal , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see a lot of changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th gain &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he put a milestone on pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is exercised by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second prize of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ ers when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but his tactical intel@@ lect differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for this sport for many years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6,000 prizes if he was not just a weekend and grand tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already rendered almost 30 years of winner in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori , has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of Grand Prix winners , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life .
Russian Putin damp@@ ens Chief of Staff Sergey Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s close friend of trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been a deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is ( in Russian ) that later he was the chief of the protocol and chief of the government staff . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ a@@ ino as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow en@@ mes@@ hed .
&quot; Ser@@ yo@@ z@@ ha Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest colleagues and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president - would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - I could almost say - to entr@@ ust my post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia since a third term of Putin viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .

ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character of Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be released at a later date , according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the d@@ sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and spent the last twelve years in my heart &apos;s blood , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a release published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans , who can only wish for a series . &quot;
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin Ba@@ in thinks it could be about 75 fish for sandals that were sp@@ illed out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ burg cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing arguments of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a d@@ ong for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high@@ - and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or west side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; he@@ els , because the toler@@ ances that the team was working towards was tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men are lucky to be alive after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst off , &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones , head of the life station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging at a Bo@@ je without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the Co@@ ast@@ guard and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it dissolved in the boiler of the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has been w@@ aking up today about these men .
seriously injured - man fights for his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and in the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
he then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companion .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building affordable housing ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be a lot stronger in future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments over the next few years ? &quot;
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept for housing &quot; at the next council session .
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the main point in the town hall is , &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still has to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; despite this , Brat@@ mann is making a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the programme is not entirely clear : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do we reconci@@ le the loss of further around 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this from happening , the planned political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of taking apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
&quot; for in the West stadt , deadlines are coming out at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 dwell@@ ings could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not mean the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no concentration of socially weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be movement in discussion .
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
this has focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been compla@@ ined by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later resulting in a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons , which are followed by a GPS , and as soon as they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase of steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; those who regularly exercise sports , reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even join new friend@@ ships in hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ oo@@ dy gam@@ bl@@ ers who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
&quot; but due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

&quot; and now , finally , Olympic Champion . &quot;
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast oc@@ cured on Thursday for a multi @-@ battle title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver Med@@ al winner and Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the solo @-@ multi @-@ campaign for women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual Americ@@ ana who wins a multi @-@ battle title and altogether the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ camp in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ an took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of retired men co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ a insisted , during her long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school discharge into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina caused by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
bri@@ ck@@ beams and ground belts - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lou@@ dly .
she recovered again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the wooden beam - and sat on top with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on picture shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her journal , became reality . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ mans &apos; performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her down@@ fall , she threw kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ an , the rapidly spreading twe@@ ets of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old have a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in a serial killer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s first mur@@ der@@ ous attacks since a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ held fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car , and subsequently fled to another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police announced that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to see if they were connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks during four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which went on an empty truck a half an hour before the triple murder , and it was assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his age mates Ed@@ mund has a micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a hel@@ per .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has considered for &quot; Please sing something before . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life associated with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I asked all the time , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
for a long time I didn &apos;t ask for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause for ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
violent ra@@ ins and widespread floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency last Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards stated that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service stated that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in the rain in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flow many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these flows only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still shr@@ ank people from flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ated and came in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife , Hans@@ ford said that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was &quot; spread quickly &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions .
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning woke up from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was seriously su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classroom failure in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that an Associ@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua 200 flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to host the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents , hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of homes on Thursday were reported to have been reported to be flooded , but on Friday they were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; Clear of bul@@ lets &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police announces that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shots , including lung , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in hospital when he was transported to hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was sco@@ oped out by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores reported to the sender . &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the sender that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in a critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just investigated whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to be a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge cases for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ came the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were leg@@ umes . &quot;
&quot; thus it seems to have given several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were very active , &quot; &quot; said Police Force Anthony G@@ inal@@ di to the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently re@@ viewing the monitoring video . &quot;
another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl hit her arm on Tuesday when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls from other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , rounds off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ n@@ astic women was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ms routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual Americ@@ ana who won gold in an individual multi @-@ event event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but do not look like sports classes all over the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic Championship will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ n@@ ast primarily in private gymnas@@ tics , maintained by parents , who pay for training , setup , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and Famili@@ es ) . the list can be continued as desired . &quot;
the majority of these Turn@@ stones lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs to support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by countless , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gym . &quot;
I founded my sports foundation of 20 years .
&quot; at my events we have offered free and affordable gym@@ n@@ astic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the young high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks to Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gil@@ ds and thank you , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their journey , become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors would like to organise further strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected it . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; No Man &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend activities , in order to improve the maintenance at times of the day . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through conversations caused the government to participate in reluct@@ ance and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made over the last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , lift up the penetration and address the worries of the assistance physicians . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work actions . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed Treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; fighting measures achieve nothing of the only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the Committee of Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively to the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the gender specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of these suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty substances in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the launch of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Systems Evaluation Centre said : &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all , the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . &quot;
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town@@ houses for ignor@@ ing electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut@@ ters outside of voting cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should carry out an identification with them in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests not to apply remote ink to a person &apos;s finger if they vote for their vote , in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election campaign in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm for the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including joining badges to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as evidence has been taken that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Lebanese background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists process letters of mail to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot; &quot;
the report taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May also requires harder registration checks in order to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social bet@@ ting purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
don &apos;t use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has handed over her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of a person &apos;s nationality to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter of letters .
prohibition that political activists process full postal elections and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police force the authority to set up lock@@ ings for electoral stations .
&quot; a law amend@@ ment , facilit@@ ating an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entative Act 1983 ) . &quot;
prohibition of taking pictures in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( with exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go to the poll@@ ing cabin on their own .
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are over the French bike sports@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of the edge and band that has proven to be an impressive double @-@ cat@@ cher of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only athlete to have gold fighting Ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe in the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; hunter and the wolf : team member of the US crew in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the track , many people in the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after images , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily , aw@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see a great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I take this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to pass through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one way higher : this user thinks Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others liked the simil@@ arities too .
&quot; theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which is similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer has died like a pig

&quot; the Canadian transmitter C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming pool .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been caught in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as he called M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ ho , 14 , swa@@ m the second leg of the swimming sta@@ ffel 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;

the I@@ di@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ dex from China was described as follows in the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming @-@ buff@@ alo for women : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which he made a lot of speech . &quot;
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people responding to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our folk music in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of float and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to make the situation worse , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued to rum@@ mage and pro@@ pped four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
Pri@@ mark Store in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman pro@@ pped the pants before putting her back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she came back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own shr@@ ub@@ s and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like to go back and forth .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b her , that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter , who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got , the staff tried to remove the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash them .
&quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been sold out of the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure .
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn around the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , you should turn around first so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with the knee into the bar and twist while the attack@@ er fights against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while she strai@@ gh@@ tens the gun on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ ten the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and worms of a serious test - by le@@ aking some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places .
&quot; the present@@ er and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a Euro ticket , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the lick of each object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of qu@@ itting the flus@@ hing knob of a pull @-@ out toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to railway stations to washing but@@ to@@ cks of toilets , the task has definitely proved its immune system under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial spread showed a lumin@@ ometric figure of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick off after her lumin@@ ometric figure was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s coming close to the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; validation Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them , and others where it was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; social housing destroyed prior to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ze social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls had perfor@@ ated holes , wooden boards were torn down , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived temporarily in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trade and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ des and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards &quot;
neighbors testified that they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ ded her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t bother anyone . &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testified that it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the village house , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the last step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will offer comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ading on the floor . &quot;
workers in the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine @-@ penalty after she had found guilty of ow@@ ning a drug of class B in commercial custody .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says they are going to del@@ ve tenants unable to comply with the rules of the house
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall announced that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not comply with the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal are pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ lor@@ ful military jet over@@ flies the beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of air@@ strip forces put an unbelievable crash
&quot; air strikes stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no safety risk &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ eff@@ er jet runs over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ s@@ burgs , without seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deeply .
the Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokesman said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to the poor visibility due to its close proximity to the area , but the air forces insisted that security was at no time end@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people also died on Madeira Island . &quot;
the Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke smoke - that limits his view .
&quot; the aircraft was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;

&quot; before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish champion doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test play of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not yet really convince Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. in the Pro@@ s@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .

Ma Long in her own league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics .
&quot; on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the world @-@ class @-@ list first ranked the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ gn@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made the title one with each other .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
they had withdrawn from the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ actors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; the matches , until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was unexpected un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he determined the pace at the top and left Z@@ hang out there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking balloon changes to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani wins the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing suffered a ri@@ pple injury and was afterwards in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to settle with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have become a similar high table tennis player Olympic Vi@@ erte . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave up weaknesses of his campaign in the up @-@ to @-@ date repub@@ lican strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the normally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilty are false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media shift . &quot;
repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by the United States of the United States of June , Tr@@ ump and his rival led by the Democrats H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , be it right , Tr@@ ump continued . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to withdraw funds to support his campaign , he should not present better results . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger than the arms . &quot;
Olympia : three sc@@ ams for dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary commission .
K@@ eni@@ as athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
&quot; after a fraud test in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately shared a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan worker told me that the former S@@ printer and present @-@ day coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case , in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup Vi@@ erter at more than 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed his country about pending d@@ oping tests against cash payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation since a long period of time . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets before the Rio Games , more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets before the Rio Games have been pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD television reports , accus@@ ations have always been raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as indicated in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
it has been proven that this sport has been comprehen@@ sively and systematically dop@@ ed in this type of sport .
&quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were expelled from the summer games . &quot;
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a romantic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix and the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s music really in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have gone to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and today they are as meaningful as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , reported reports in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ed land and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school @-@ girls from the east of London climbed to a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the confirmation of Gar@@ lands since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that Clinton expects &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; to select &quot; &quot; certain degree of certainty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Tribunal for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;

Tre@@ ats wants Nu@@ de Calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us earlier this year that his neck magazine is distingu@@ ishable from old school play@@ boys since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar does also .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass ex@@ odus
&quot; whoever does not adapt himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ imminent Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even &quot; become a few hundred thousand , &quot; believes the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; following the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already over@@ taken Kurdish strongh@@ olds with fac@@ tions months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey are on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional eth@@ ni@@ city Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees itself , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Chief of the Association demanded that the Federal Government be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is held . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition leaders . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a quality trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adapt himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and s@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ imminent Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the paper on figures of the Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers who have recognised asylum rights in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all registered asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no sense of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the state @-@ day election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not stupid to be so far : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who want to be convinced by the bal@@ lot fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are some practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and count on the end of votes , are only tedi@@ ous to apply . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass through election campaign almost by the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
&quot; what is exciting is how strong the newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of the coalition matter . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous campaig@@ ning fight , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as he did his legendary , elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make an election campaign at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel on corporate events ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ amp is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other states , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany too .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , like Kok@@ ert , plays only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country , it crum@@ bles the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ se of the country . &quot;
&quot; the advice of the CD@@ U @-@ campaig@@ ners Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday celebration must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the SPD was still clearly winning at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of the holiday need , and transfer their election campaign largely into the internet . &quot;
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on search for traces of native voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ts with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ isches lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer under blocking
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is re@@ structured , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end up at 8@@ pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty much , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the receipt will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work , such as when it comes to the establishment of accommodation arrangements . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been w@@ ander@@ ed to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the village has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
ev@@ asion through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there have been some significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer , Florian King , responsible for the administrative management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping things were looking for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to the fran@@ chis@@ ement of some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality demanded to strengthen the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; says King , who made himself informed of the situation on the spot . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the fastest one was on the road at 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue break@@ through@@ s allows everyone to look through .
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the end customer , i.e. for other companies , have little consequences for the renovation . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ er@@ ship Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no more slight drop &quot; but also states that , of course , &quot; the race is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most bag@@ ged are the restaurants along the street .
&quot; Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 per cent &quot; , &quot; the revenue losses date back to &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road marking started its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation with the hint , the restaurant otherwise benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it also has to bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where such a little more generous was handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; the fact that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive out , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his trunk @-@ cap returns to the end of the renovation work .
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
six months of construction work is brutal .
it is constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ mon .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not challenge anybody .
other additional points would first be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
&quot; as the Minister of the Interior , however , he was on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but that &apos;s all the more extensive .
&quot; some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U . &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
they partly have it in themselves : he is planning screening procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for imprisonment of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones in advance and expose social media accounts for a safety check .
&quot; in the event of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some of them also seem in@@ ex@@ hor@@ ted and leaves un@@ answered questions .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg assass@@ ins were refugees .
&quot; moreover , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that pro@@ found@@ ly occupied people , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election campaign times . &quot;
the focus is on inner security .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are competitions . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly gaining ground in the issue of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high rise between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the facilities of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the head of the department also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling with conci@@ li@@ atory tones here too .
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from a double pass .
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not useful .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things to do for dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to defend itself on the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further enhance security . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen is getting worse . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t run around in all markets .
&quot; with the recall action , there is a fuss about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year when it comes to deliveries .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can still boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the VW &apos;s core brand was weaker in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sale , as reported by the company in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1,@@ 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
deliveries by almost one sixth in Germany &apos;s home market declined .
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of marketing manager , led the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there has been a purchase reserve in some core markets due to &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation in Turkey around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on withdrawal from the EU also bur@@ dened a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the primarily affected household brand of Lower Saxony is further sub@@ lim@@ ated by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only one delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Chief Executive Officer Fred Kap@@ pler further showed sales growth . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust gas test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirms that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact . &quot;
&quot; after changing the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after conversion , the car manufacturer guarantees a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in company circles . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , legal entities are legal entities . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Focus , &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday of VW &apos;s representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry committee and the KBA Complete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting will not take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was mentioned in company circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after conversion , customers can come to a workshop for about half a year - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damages that have nothing to do with the waste @-@ loss scandal are a uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was mentioned . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , bank chief Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not regard it as a signal : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; do not have to worry about paying pen@@ alties for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot;
&quot; banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee is required by the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day @-@ to @-@ day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 euros will be 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he has kept 40 million Euros that could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not evaluate . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and generate 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for each million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , he continues to bear the costs . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and changed to other investments .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operative Association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to bear alone is not possible &quot; &quot; economically . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some German banks have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ er- and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay flat fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is a little more luxuri@@ ant by the fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if they guard for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the Co@@ operative Bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; no further banks are currently known to the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria , which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into the negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany won &apos;t let it fall in the width .
destination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
&quot; before you ha@@ sten to the comment section , to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of a male middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ discussed re@@ birth of records is not a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely target group . &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o I wear a modest gray suit and run wild , before I stop , hold my hands and say something b@@ ump@@ y like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic plate speci@@ als . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , whom I wrote by Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early se@@ ven@@ ties that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people generally have been dischar@@ ged to their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a given age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business such as Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that keep happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people . &quot;
it is a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a panel . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not listened to them yet .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while crossing a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone only came here recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ class . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates , has a colourful audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and women middle @-@ aged . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ be@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz , it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ iling psychological trauma is hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping tour than a wholesale purchase .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to wear jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls , who are group@@ ed around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there &apos;s nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that gives most for luxury items such as records . &quot;
&quot; even though my research has shown that You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s results vote , they don &apos;t take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security not with stro@@ lling through panels of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who ra@@ ges over the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French court den@@ ies offer of demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to buy 72 temporary stores in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , sell bar@@ ber services or sell simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture has argued that these places should be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , which could provide a fire and health risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also suggested that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the &quot; &quot; Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café in the camp , which is in common use and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle @-@ bearing living has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains comb@@ ative
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to enter@@ tain himself . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , keep confident and fight , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; to me it is honestly hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he must , in peace , analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
I will look at everything we have changed in recent times .
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion who lost 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video game trans@@ missions
watching other people watching video games is a huge success - Microsoft also wants to benefit .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am that special@@ ises in this hobby .
&quot; on Thursday , Microsoft did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also grab yourself . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot;
the game eri@@ dge Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
&quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help . &quot;
the advertising industry is already listening .
&quot; the start @-@ up team , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ les : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are tested , which should effectively super@@ se@@ duce the speed . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , at highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed pol@@ arity there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ ender for compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days at un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans by time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that it is not simply st@@ owed away , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear in a secure outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji won Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is on Thursday evening when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji given a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , back @-@ back , linear and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consol@@ ation price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall for them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
&quot; eight years ago , under R@@ yan they lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lose only one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let the attack G@@ Bs boun@@ ce out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co . , as if you were running in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went to top 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ sted in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a splendid T@@ ack@@ le von Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute Jeh@@ oi@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a sent a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ umes by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji being born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ an whose fans sang , flags pi@@ ped and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced themselves and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ ushing into the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a narrow semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks up in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning are inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants what is to be called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard drives that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she moved to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ 000 un@@ varn@@ ished commitment , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and nobody knew whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nervous morning to talk a little more than anything else , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking for something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about the future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary care taken for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria &apos;s exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian pot@@ able water supply association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk ( Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk ) some time ago .
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia government acknowledged the purpose of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; is regarded as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , stands for 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the pot@@ able water supply association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the communities of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach are member municipalities . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she named the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and repar@@ ations of the farmers , the renovation of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ plac@@ ements of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and there were always new additions , because water meant life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived down@@ right the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water keeper and he was a loyal boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of well and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the pipeline at Kirch@@ der on January 3 . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can also be maintained once only because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
&quot; the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko leaves with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it .
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has come up well and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; to give an example : when I ask him something about what is two years old when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots to partner in life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday .
&quot; the man called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after he is publicly tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown burnt and has a bald head . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. should call 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information about the conduct or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a law of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are not saying more , &quot; &quot; said a police officer in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green energy extraction are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the release of the renewable energy conversion in the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we finally managed to reach .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is applied . &quot;
but even this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a particular significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading law , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of products threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers introduce price d@@ umping in Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel have effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have accumulated . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have been stagn@@ ating again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers are cau@@ tious in July . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Economic Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief increase in May , the quantity produced now went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is up by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more vivid , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for this , senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who demand his lungs on a regular basis do not get out of the doll as quickly as they are in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia patients dis@@ miss in long @-@ standing events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir too .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 people singing , who li@@ stens to when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ iors &quot; choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .

&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research . &quot;

cats react more sensi@@ tively than males on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover what effect the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens have on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males cold - however they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of patho@@ gen of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen , who find themselves in great need , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
males react even to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology .
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ am differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a call of small ones , which were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned around faster to the loudspeaker , when the loop of the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens was playing . &quot;
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noise . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women responded more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were already pregnant or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , there is again an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch @-@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even when the state of emergency after the overthrow of the revolution in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the motion of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , football is not stopped even before football . &quot;
against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
&quot; accordingly , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kis@@ r is said to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days still until October , it actually does not have any impact on the life of most Turks however . &quot;
the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy guard &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdoğan last Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club traditionally do not rank among the friends of the president .
&quot; but what unites the great majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch . &quot;
even fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will especially arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne @-@ based team demonstrated its sporting value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
&quot; in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ down in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also retired early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we &apos;ve done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of the game was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment @-@ King laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , who was under contract with the AC Florence , had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario however wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; said the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to renoun@@ ce about a third of his annual salary of € 7.5 million , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio , Germany &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other trans@@ vers@@ ed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at this - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had acc@@ ented her starting right before the games after a dop@@ ing ban , was fully whi@@ st@@ led off at her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it offered a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with a raised smile , she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a celeb@@ r@@ ity that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a rush storm . &quot;
but there are many more sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championship , was tested positively by meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the smu@@ g@@ gling and was locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est rates this year go to the account of the big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion more than 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and was closed 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , stun@@ ned Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ton &apos;s throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards . &quot;
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to leave Olympic Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games he received due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favor@@ i@@ tin has only been tested positive in May but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found evidence of taking a banned food supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and started on 13 July . &quot;
bom@@ bed terror in Thailand - Viol@@ ated in Austria - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from cuts and was treated in the hospital , but I have already left it . &quot;
they planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also Austrian citizens are affected , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in , initially on Thursday evening , had explo@@ ded two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , Thai nationals were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two bla@@ sting heads went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket there was a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive rate went into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee to journalists Friday morning . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express himself to possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokesperson in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; the authorities would have received secret evidence for imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days , but they were not informed of the exact date and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is lying behind the attacks .
&quot; the police ordered their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the bom@@ b@@ astic explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for any necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were cancelled a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution executed by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; the Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , helped itself to bring the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; just one year ago , in Bangkok , a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine was killed 20 people , most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several nation@@ alities , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist fashion from the Islamic faith or the Middle East . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional Compla@@ int in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ ty . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely att@@ un@@ ed to the national offices in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ties Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; in general extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ it@@ ous advertisement for your own cause .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point onwards . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether or not the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the clear increase of legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelter , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or groups of small groups , who plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were built on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ arten expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects on asylum seekers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; a lot of people have committed crimes that have not worked at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted float from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ m so slowly that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; quickly , the first nick@@ names made the round . &quot;
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel des W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; was funny about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m free @-@ style , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run ensured media attention . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to compete alone in a race over 100 meters of free @-@ standing . &quot;
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never done such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the new place has been emp@@ tied .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left her shop on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 euros had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending election defeat too tight
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking on an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video . &quot;
he then drives into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse or I have a very , very beautiful , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the CN@@ BC television station . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
post climbs into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electrical delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously high .
the mail plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; shortly , the corporation wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ter from the coming year also on the open car market .
&quot; we want to embar@@ k on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been checking whether or not to sell its own developed stream sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , even to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ ald announced that the Group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly and , in the long term , a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we outline the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K guidance occurs after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ lights suddenly came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the Market Research Group Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uns@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management stands the world &apos;s number five in front of a new beginning .
the company plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahler , already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the management of the Management Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , who shared the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the tail@@ backs , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
&quot; for details , a company spokesman did not want to name it on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for those who , in the future , lead the market research company , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring initiated two years ago was great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K at the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the latest bad Gf@@ K figures , each shareholder will some@@ day be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ts like that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company failed to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , revenue was 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s previous year . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.@@ 4 percent with € 72@@ 1.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was above all imp@@ acted by the lower value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience division , secured a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros under the line . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
&quot; during an accident of a travel coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( Aur@@ ich County ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade a vice vice who partly drove on the opposite lane . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; because of the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the place of accident on the straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
&quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot;
the investig@@ ators called on the trucks and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fee per cubic meter will amount to 2.@@ 10 euros for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.3 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 euros ( up to 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed . &quot;
&quot; after a higher calculation , the wastewater award in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the district office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Unter@@ deck@@ ungen had been established for these sewage plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal principles , the market of Kaz@@ endorf is required to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Head of Administration , Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater treatment of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overl@@ app@@ ings and under@@ cover from the previous calendar period may also be offset . &quot;
Schmidt stated that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
&quot; as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expendi@@ tures , the underlying calculation of all three plants was not least incurred due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for world th@@ igh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water system Az@@ endorf because of a damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be evacu@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses contributed to the continued care and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment the expenses for operation and maintenance were completely over@@ flow@@ ed in the three plants .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large @-@ scale entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , particularly as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater treatment association can not be expanded because it is a matter of deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 amounted to 10.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in advance for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed &quot;
&quot; snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ unt , stand@@ alone tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ carriage returns to the public .
&quot; in the past , snap@@ chat filters have criti@@ qu@@ ed criticism in which they were accused of promoting either black face or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and darker che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage was widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was meant to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful , &quot; said to be uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the confrontation of a very rep@@ ul@@ sive Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degra@@ ding extre@@ m . &quot;
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and ordered others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , which has left Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its staff , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently set up a personnel officer focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , for her part , said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; the military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it allowed the actual states on site to report in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican members of the military committees , intelligence committees and military budget com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command , intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
intelligence information generated by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders typically marked a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services . &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the Cent@@ Com leadership errors extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence indicating that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin already in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Congress of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to shut down the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigations will be continued .
&quot; in addition , the Cent@@ Com reports are being conducted by the Secretary General of the Defense Department . &quot;
democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; said the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat , member of the Adam B. Shi@@ p House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; sh@@ amed the morality among analysts and gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats agreed not to have found any evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were admitted to Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; critics concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall between more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush did not fores@@ ee only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , stating that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ n commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States win fourth match in women &apos;s field hockey , a show@@ down with the UK &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American soccer team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; she knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the UK and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed winner will take a little longer from the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man who will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising confusion due to their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 squares . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she wasn &apos;t able to qualify for the ca@@ des .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work place in London that we now have .
we have been able to complete the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back cover from the close range .
&quot; India went into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and hit the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had a goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amidst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are steady and ines@@ capable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow guard to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to a gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you cannot turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ opol@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ ens s@@ warm with dimples , could well have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not highlight any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke swim and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I want to make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ ingly perceived that many of them , I asked , did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the jumping competition and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are rated according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts need to move forward in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they chase not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another high goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympic @-@ record . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the V@@ ector of the trampoline ing@@ inger is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the spru@@ ce and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to come to the air . &quot;
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia stum@@ bled upon the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa , and its stability is appreciated by the west . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restra@@ ined , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following an extensive election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den that have been defeated more or less in recent years could use turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness gradually explo@@ de after years of de@@ bit@@ ing under the surface .
the first appears harmless : smart phones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming increasingly common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered so much to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while explo@@ iting the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but this too is changing .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ ler Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who constitute about 6 percent of the population , dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had until his death a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered tactical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , coming from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which were apparently ple@@ dged by the government according to the statements of analysts , and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an town , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ es flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , attacking his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , to explain to the peculiar position that he might not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump agreed on Thursday &apos;s claim and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism jumped down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling changes . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more corro@@ sive tone since his survey results have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to not excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump j@@ okes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , had great difficulty in defending the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it rear @-@ bro@@ kers , completely false , and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around and being taken against him on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the poor , miserable &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café gets back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; the Cafe was a Cer@@ tified Café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but for it 15 years of good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prizes were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
&quot; soap Cher@@ ie , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native people smoked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved club café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
verb used the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also driven by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was shut , she gave up coffee drinking a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that liked me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no p@@ enny about the fact that the soap store had taken up the old business room .
&quot; indeed , the owner of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for use with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he anticipated to leave her soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tor@@ to@@ ise soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ acking , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have been placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ates for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; paints the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as tight as the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; &quot; noted Ziegel@@ man , since coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
quir@@ ky mixes have been tried out because a low @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction prev@@ ails over taste or even healthy kitchen expertise .
&quot; during her research for the book which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the family recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , house@@ keeping - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge of transforming pamp@@ as such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historic treats .
&quot; especially tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while publicly commen@@ ding the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he served as the millions @-@ heavy man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt contributed to the fact that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother in law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; She was really sick . &quot;
there was the case of wind@@ ling .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they drew a dessert that they prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said and added that it was a common plo@@ y to miss modest recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone showed a little reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E took a rash three times .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ter , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even in the Assad regime &apos;s barrel bomb attack .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group , which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life in the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and help in the war area first aid .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , showing him at an 11 hour rescue of a baby from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans bright symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; he never saw himself as a hero , according to the picture : &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the toxic remains of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s hair only gets offspring with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it counts , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland hai , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long that Greenland &apos;s hair is stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
&quot; their slow @-@ winding speed they measured , when they stopped six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream , and search for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ates from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland @-@ arks , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest is 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the l@@ enti@@ cular core of the sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons @-@ seeking larger quantities of this radioactive carbon trapped in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the l@@ enti@@ cular core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it could have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular core , resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res was even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was well @-@ known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined 156 years ago , Greenland &apos;s hair with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates currently .
it is no coincidence that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , whose bacon on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was captured in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame . &quot;
they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the loss of heat of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest his resources into a long life . &quot;
building site in a double pack
&quot; with topics related to building , the Municipal Council has dealt with a focus on the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Panel made the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the land , plot and settlement issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Stre@@ der@@ straße &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion phase 1 ) were no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the land areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and other sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ vil@@ lige can immediately report to the town hall , on the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to be advised in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also meet requests for the res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year in partial areas . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial estate already designated there will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; accordingly , the city of the Main has the best chance to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores should continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK so far . &quot;
most of them are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association counts 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk segment . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg indeed owns a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin det@@ rac@@ ts in the infrastructure worse . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city has a slightly available commercial property . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is standing in seventh place , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , the econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , there were around 14@@ 4,000 people working in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. federal judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents filed by Mer@@ ck , which , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead , uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US representative Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the cancellation of the costs incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to balance the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .

U.S. supported troops say that they have re@@ conquered complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the United States have captured the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokesman of the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , following the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently living the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , deta@@ ined by the fighters as ho@@ stages , distributed Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the Clin@@ tons donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in speech hon@@ or@@ aries ; former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the past ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal to refuse . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons election campaign hel@@ pers Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in regards to the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump special advis@@ er , said CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections were not finished . &quot;
&quot; critics , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his forms of business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and released a video on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to release his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke of the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the past few decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants , the indications that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange its tax returns . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that they only purchased USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons distributed divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ es and fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , intensified its funding along with U.S. nature conservation , by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvest without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the world phone number dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without causing harm to the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth , mixed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition threshold . &quot;
&quot; when lit , the con@@ dom p@@ ushes up with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ es into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a row@@ er , who shoots a gold fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot;
the City Council unanim@@ ously decides : no building of ki@@ os@@ ks at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects for traders with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and are taking place - especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be much tough@@ er . &quot;
&quot; however , the municipal coun@@ cill@@ or refused to apply for the construction of a sales ski@@ pper at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ Baltic Convention . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ closes Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT news
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election as it requested Arabic guests according to an employee .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; published his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; ch@@ okes him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; was quoted by the cler@@ k of Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the Internet , where people called the whole thing a scandal . &quot;
some enter@@ tained the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; she said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; to include Israel in the quick election list , &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police relies on tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms to the public educational system . &quot;
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the enforcement of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their short@@ com@@ ings on the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money . &quot;
some of the protests were seen by Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er to spray walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ v@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on the sides of Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador announced . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new firms are willing to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ v@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation made some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians attend Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses wanted : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been practiced on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ der Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had hu@@ gged their faces away from the beverage market &apos;s employee were asking for the release of cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and the gravel parking lot situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer season
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the first week of the school , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of the school . &quot;
several day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the stro@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
to the other after Maul@@ bron@@ n where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group was enjoying the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and pl@@ unge . &quot;
&quot; culinary delights served by children and car@@ egi@@ vers with their homemade car@@ ts such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were stained , beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people were happy to return home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the mini stran@@ ts from the Ey@@ esh@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna &apos;s pastoral care unit were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were completed . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ ance trip of all the stran@@ ts into two years , the head of the Order of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a three @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the B@@ ish@@ ops City of Fri@@ bourg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the opening of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gre@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy @-@ rooms made their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and shared the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; each day and evening , each day was framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely made a break to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , par@@ son@@ ages of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; on the stages , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , Fur@@ tw@@ angen came to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day . &quot;
&quot; the next step was to climb the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first it had to be lowered about 500 metres of altitude and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing Clo@@ ister Church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Freiburg Min@@ ster and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was given thanks . &quot;
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is co @-@ ordin@@ ated by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Brit@@ on won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had turned into E@@ igen .
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships , despite the arrival of Ho@@ ys . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; in the qualification round , Kenn@@ y , Kenn@@ y - who prevailed four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic tournament in the qualification laps , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ du went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make myself a name .
we have set up an Olympic board in the final round and the world champi@@ ons defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part next to the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
&quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
&quot; he had argued yesterday with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK Team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; dra@@ mas took place in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of S@@ esto and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ proposals as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of Port@@ land melt @-@ up due to cancellation of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria in the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy scheduled for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the enam@@ el consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Mel@@ ting , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting mill with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from that point onwards , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in its annual subscription amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of termination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have come into force from November this year even though there is still a statement on why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn due to the poor economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and a total of 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
should both systems disappear from the market it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é story almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence &quot; &quot; You thought we should forget you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a play@@ site at 8@@ am in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still going through before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the mod@@ eled &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , falls under the previous category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapshot video ( even if everything is applicable to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always a bit stra@@ ined . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mist@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but walking around the face seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters are selling images of themselves on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; approximately 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary power needs are rejected annually by the municipalities , while the industry is focused on the effects of further mid @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ances and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which have already been over@@ loaded , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of the Gover@@ ning Centr@@ es of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are already dismissed every year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services that you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been released un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 onwards , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly drew gun
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that , in February , their campaign leader for North Carolina had set up a gun @-@ gun on an employee while they were in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ord@@ i preten@@ ded to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he admitted in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate released an uph@@ eav@@ al when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival would be elected H@@ illary Clinton and judge judges . &quot;
&quot; the campaign made clear that the media had torn his words out of context , and that he would not push for violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign to viol@@ ate the duty of care , and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental harm . &quot;
&quot; hope Hi@@ cks , press spokesperson , was not to be reached for a statement . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip just failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls to his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has led a controversial campaign . &quot;
&quot; the procedure is B@@ ord@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties are notable . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was just close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD in the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , according to the survey , would only be 23 per cent ( choice of 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they were thus behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties for the first time . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would , on the contrary , miss the introduction in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came to the stores exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ Browser , albeit agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found themselves .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today the market is domin@@ ating providers that came to the market much later than Nokia .
&quot; being online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday for a lot of people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet Communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the following . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ Ber@@ ry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
&quot; 20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens board for staff . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , permanent availability is regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time . &quot;
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring about renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , as well as in 2012 in London when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and foreign companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
&quot; the doub@@ ters had been wrong in 2012 , and they will also be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any asked question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in fun growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to turn this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad block@@ age &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , attempts to b@@ ypass ad block@@ age are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; according to one of the software manufacturers . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus posted a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop site would change coding on its advertisements in order to make it harder to recognise the recognition of which part of the advertising page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ battle between the present Open Source Community and the Shift has been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display @-@ lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users , who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising generates 84 percent of advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has , apart from ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokesman . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs has a large share of revenues so that Facebook appears to be an investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; advertising preferences &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be more wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman in case of presum@@ ed suicide to over@@ ride on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday over@@ came a presum@@ ed suicide of several cars on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman wanted to kill herself at the age of 49 , which was carried over by several vehicles , including a truck . &quot;
she still died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these and any witnesses of the incident call on to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases where a person in the dark ran on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was mentioned in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the casual kill@@ ings after having passed and killed a man who lay in August 2014 on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the Ju@@ dge . &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabited
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turning of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io stated in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this he@@ ats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought of planet researchers .
&quot; although it was supposedly inhabited , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans are evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our has been blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen discharge , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needed and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot;
Nor@@ el@@ ee@@ pers take talks again and strike a strike
&quot; the work struggles with respect to the remuneration for North sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties involved in a new round of talks are at the table , the negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its counterpart in North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell released thousands of people and announced plans to give up oil and gas business in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ association with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are related to planetary development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these gri@@ pping stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by real@@ ising the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotate slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much ahead of us about what we would like to know more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ aden rot@@ ational rates , which are soon to appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; following his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both , &quot; &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 year old should not be admitted to the hall of glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside of the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect for having received high @-@ performance funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 times . &quot;
&quot; the League could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at the time . &quot;
even his farewell days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and following the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski can not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a learned athlete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day of the competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the pre @-@ runs of more than 50 m of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history no longer is the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news about the positive rehear@@ sal happened at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should act on the banned substance around the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ specimen should already have a positive effect . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported immediately his criticism of the Journal .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the entire Russian team to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the event of swimming , the previous tre@@ aties in China also ensured serious disputes between the athletes . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of free style , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French Radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been tested positively by the Chinese nationals for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but only had to sit a three month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently attacking companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
40 per cent of the cas@@ u@@ alties willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for er@@ asing ran@@ som is considerably higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes director Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; private users were only the target , but the change to company attacks occurred over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users find the personal photo @-@ database on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops . &quot;
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
&quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of turnover through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop the business operation completely , in one case , people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in view of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ acker on the other hand know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ code example files for free . &quot;
&quot; and when private business@@ men are rede@@ emed after payment of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data back un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the so @-@ called malware kits were created by buying malware , counsel@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ outs are then looking for more hack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is processed per infected computer .
&quot; the criminals usually use sp@@ amm@@ ers to spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now well @-@ known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes trial put their trust in defending ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes director Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new goals in the internet of things into the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators , instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could be a subject in Industry 4.0 as well . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the top of the cockpit is falling apart . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l when raised and 10@@ 26 l is available for back@@ rests , but the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seating areas of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie chair , providing storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; he should , however , make his work a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine version : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the top @-@ version &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when manoeu@@ v@@ ring , he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
&quot; and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ servo responds to traffic sign recognition and , if required , re@@ acts the speed . &quot;
&quot; the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack are lying under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline does not take any responsibility : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is only conceivable with dangers which are typical of air transport .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of disease : when paid by the Organ@@ izer
&quot; after their trip , ill travelers will only get back money if the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have demonstrated the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a negotiated case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; their illness brought back the tourists to a defective treatment plant , which was supposed to contam@@ inate the sea water . &quot;
the family believed that the trip was so poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the wastewater treatment plant was defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the pla@@ inti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was ok .
&quot; so he did not hurt his duties , so the judgment . &quot;
&quot; especially in the samples of the water , no im@@ puri@@ ties were found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by plu@@ gging one another - is one of the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the state had to act prud@@ ently and decisi@@ vely to react to terrorism . &quot;
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if perpetr@@ ators would have to leave the country faster , however , safety and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under penalty again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is am@@ ended to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the internet . &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is intended to remain in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps increase security further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly expressed himself against action .
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality earlier .
&quot; a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , however , is un@@ constitutional . &quot;
&quot; you cannot forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules in traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terrorism packages and capacity to act .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway network
&quot; it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ ypass road , here a picture of November . &quot;
&quot; however , this should change : the rule of law shall be extended . &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the environmental road every night in traffic jams when driving across the Autobahn or Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction is extended by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Road and the Wes@@ er Straße descent . &quot;
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
&quot; the major advantage is that the transport shares early , whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return sta@@ u extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ ta way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided in a single lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rec@@ alled in a three @-@ quarters years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had resulted in the fact that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to record two @-@ track heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated week@@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent regional company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining period of up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays , because with disabilities it may be expected . &quot;
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday to the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; Das invisible Haus . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Chil@@ d@@ house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel , &quot; initiated by the club N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the staging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the students of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language education are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ sni@@ ff @-@ Gu@@ ests in the southwest of Germany on Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
what are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and various causes may be underlying them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping up and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; but what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so a single and di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el , says just the passing through . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be put behind it , but also medicines . &quot;
it is not rare that sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is particularly frequent in depression , &quot; says Weber . &quot;
and it can be that different factors imply each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a disc failure , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to say hello to everyday problems and worries . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should sleep distur@@ b the doctor ?
&quot; if you are not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , you should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etz , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should contact the family doctor if you suffer from sleeping problems . &quot;
this can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to bed or what happens ?
&quot; for an examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of sickness @-@ like fatigue , sleep @-@ conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ ord . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ é . &quot;
&quot; after covering , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera shows the sleeping ends at the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of inter@@ locking screws that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t sleep too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , not watching TV for falling asleep , avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ appo@@ inting trimm@@ ing of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first caught gold at the short @-@ track world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has been protecting himself against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a junk King of 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming sports is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not even look closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you do not have a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : prisoner of baggage arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ bag and bag ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf airport saw a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ enses . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences this year since mid @-@ July and were in the process of common , work@@ able and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ min@@ alist Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove four actions to the Di@@ eben , who had travelled to Germany for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; in total , they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still a rem@@ nant of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like the first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be torn down , will be built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy city district , &quot; such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are , however , favor@@ ed by burning cars in the last few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , in the meantime the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , police pat@@ rolled out parts of the street with 30 to 40 officials and three men on site , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers were renov@@ ating the premises on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers departed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late . &quot;
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
&quot; left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who lives here three children , are particularly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wishes to get a majority of police protection from the v@@ and@@ alizing left .
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police arise between the occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in , in the East of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police command in a real road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them against cast@@ ed pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been dis@@ car@@ ded with colored bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; Left Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : criminal off@@ ences such as injury to the body are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences make tangible damages , which tend to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , who were certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was also so important that the local residents got back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the sol@@ itude of the district . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former construction sites that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t approve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out people who are anno@@ yed about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who walks into a pub area that can complain poorly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee policy officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the dev@@ our@@ ing Woll@@ mel@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed rather than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write out the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force has been sought with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , just an aff@@ ection@@ ate Woll@@ mel@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straße &quot;
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the district council office to the commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find private homes . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work , so it is necessary to rely on private housing , &quot; says Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community dwell@@ ings need to be emp@@ tied , as it is called so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fra@@ yed or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; thus , administration and volunteers are also jumping here . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there is also problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always also to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already an &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would bring them back completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they have always in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the politicians are afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the certificates are already at full capacity to integrate the existing people wis@@ ely .
&quot; currently there are about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men forci@@ bly entered an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .

&quot; both men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ls . &quot;
they fled towards the city center .
&quot; at the time of the investigation , the police used several strikes as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag was without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown occurred near the apartment or in their escape . &quot;
