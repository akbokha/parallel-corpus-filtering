<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "gold sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the riding career ended again."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself run with his family on the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even shoot for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also with CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the German sport aid handed over the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala, the Golden Sports Pyramid."</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th award winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been supporting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master sieger was recorded on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast of Eberhard Gienger, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the champion Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball of Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company wandered to the Springstadion, where the lava price was running."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and bumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal TTP - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US Presidency applicants are undivided in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "Trump wants to keep the doubts in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive regulations drastically, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has opportunities to open and need money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would be increased," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost exactly the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, there could still be internal discussions on Trump."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energy with its investment program and demands:" a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transatlantic trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, both the USA do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, says Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says," "The minimum wage must rise, then he says he cannot be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months will probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics say to him, that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">"escape:" "every fled woman has experience with sexual violence" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son into the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the division manager of Condrobs, a supporter of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the setup together with Pro Familia and the Munich-based Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experience of sexual violence in her escape," Bahr says. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that the smugglers call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the North of Munich are traumatized, appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experienced, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not know how to help, they need more accommodations just for them, called Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some answers to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their competence area.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors in some common shelters or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accomodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or are housed together men and women, it may be - perpetually - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much women feel this need for protection can be read at the Andine, which is available at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"we have been waiting around for a long waiting list," Bahr says. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The deputy of the assistance doctors called on their union to approve new combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the beginning of September, the Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for more labour action."</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had given orders to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" persistently quiet "would have had problems, which led to the refusal of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Board of Management has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating labour action measures commenced at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors went six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of BMA resident physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the sessions, which were still held before the vote by 54,000 resident physicians and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrowly and he hardly had any warmth, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as though he had never done anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating and sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing which he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into Russia's back.</seg>
<seg id="16">Going down was even bigger as it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the cousins is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria being controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get, after he has been relieved of his death in a failed coup d" état last month. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports were allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti phrased it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continuing grudge on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relation to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" "alliance of outsiders" "as an analyst: two countries that feel violated from the West and feel ill-treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently acted as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they hadn't even touched the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will speak at least once more."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is (in Russian) that later he was the chief of the protocol and chief of the government staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your trust. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow enmeshed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Seryozha Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest colleagues and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president - would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say - I could almost say - to entrust my post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia since a third term of Putin violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the northern deck of the Queensburg crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing arguments of the" "deck blower", "which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a dong for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or west side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by an incline of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors should be a lot stronger in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 affordable apartments over the next few years? "</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept for housing" at the next council session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the main point in the town hall is," Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still has to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, Bratmann is making a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the programme is not entirely clear: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do we reconcile the loss of further around 1,300 inexpensive apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this from happening, the planned political spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of taking apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the West stadt, deadlines are coming out at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 dwellings could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not mean the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically, it is removed from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no concentration of socially weak in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be movement in discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been complained by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later resulting in a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are followed by a GPS, and as soon as they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase of steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "30 minutes time" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day" "hit deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"those who regularly exercise sports, reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join new friendships in hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also moody gamblers who have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"but due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="17">"she expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="30">"Raismans' performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix's first murderous attacks since a decade, while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls from other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, rounds off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnastic women was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterful Gyms routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual Americana who won gold in an individual multi-event event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but do not look like sports classes all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic Championship will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnast primarily in private gymnastics, maintained by parents, who pay for training, setup, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and Families). the list can be continued as desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnstones lie in prosperous suburbs to support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to be inspired by countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gym."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my sports foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the young high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by the Holes of the Olympic team gilds and thank you, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their journey, become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected it."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend activities, in order to improve the maintenance at times of the day."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Assistance, announced last night in a communication with:" "assistance doctors have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">"only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through conversations caused the government to participate in reluctance and sometimes deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">"this was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made over the last month, that his door would always be open."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the last two months, we spoke to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded positively to the concerns of guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education and the gender specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA agreements in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored as an annihilating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and townhouses for ignoring electoral abuse due to" hypersensitivity in ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption scandal, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shutters outside of voting cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should carry out an identification with them in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter only has to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report suggests not to apply remote ink to a person's finger if they vote for their vote, in order to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to congregational documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election campaign in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court decided that the acting mayor Lutsk Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation where one person chooses someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm for the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including joining badges to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said:" "as evidence has been taken that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in accordance with the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Lebanese background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists process letters of mail to stop" reaping. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The report taken into consideration by Theresa May also requires harder registration checks in order to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social betting purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Don't use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has handed over her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of a person's nationality to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter of letters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists process full postal elections and envelopes of letters.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police force the authority to set up lockings for electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"a law amendment, facilitating an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act (People's Representative Act 1983)."</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of taking pictures in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (with exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go to the polling cabin on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" amazing, "that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral tribunal has declared Lutsk Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "checkups" "of the election registration departments of the town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said:" "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal."</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit more secure.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhone Mizrachi, Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn around the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and go out of the line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then beat him with the knee into the bar and twist while the attacker fights against pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while she straightens the gun on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and straighten the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and worms of a serious test - by leaking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a Euro ticket, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the lick of each object, he used an Luminometer to show up and show us what he will get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to the daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of quitting the flushing knob of a pull-out toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to railway stations to washing buttocks of toilets, the task has definitely proved its immune system under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was justified in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial spread showed a luminometric figure of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after her luminometric figure was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That's coming close to the worst thing I've got in a toilet." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended with saying "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them, and others where it was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="1">"social housing destroyed prior to Delogize social housing in Saltash, Cornwall"</seg>
<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their social apartment after a delogization with a loss of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had perforated holes, wooden boards were torn down, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who lived temporarily in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trade and excessive screams, strides and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors testified that they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloded her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogization was cheered by lightened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't bother anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the village house, trash and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogification is always the last step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be awful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community, who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will offer comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">"a dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloading on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine-penalty after she had found guilty of owning a drug of class B in commercial custody.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says they are going to delve tenants unable to comply with the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall announced that delogization was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not comply with the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked the confirmation of Garlands since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"on Thursday, Reid said during a telephone conference that Clinton expects" "Garland" "to select" "certain degree of certainty". ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reid said later that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not adapt himself and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-imminent Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany reckons with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even" become a few hundred thousand, "believes the president of the association Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"following the coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection-seekers from Turkey in Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says the President Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already overtaken Kurdish strongholds with factions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on the run."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the coup d" état, secular and oppositional ethnicity Turks were added. "</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that assimilates refugees itself, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the chief of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or distributed over the past hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also a CDU member."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chief of the Association demanded that the Federal Government be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany, too, a" witch hunt "against Erdogan critics is held."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition leaders."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a quality trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not adapt himself and praises Erdogan, is sitting on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and sculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-imminent Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as reported by the paper on figures of the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers who have recognised asylum rights in Germany before the coup."</seg>
<seg id="22">"on the reporting date June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all registered asylum seekers (39,625)."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the state-day election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it's not stupid to be so far: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who want to be convinced by the ballot fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so are not allowed to choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are some practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers and count on the end of votes, are only tedious to apply."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass through election campaign almost by the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">"what is exciting is how strong the newcomer AfD cuts off, and what remains at the end of the coalition matter."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaigning fight, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as he did his legendary, eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We create that" "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make an election campaign at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel on corporate events; Merkel Bundestagswamp is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other states," "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany too.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, like Kokert, plays only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noticed that in the country, it crumbles the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanse of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the advice of the CDU-campaigners Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-exposing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in 2011, the SPD was still clearly winning at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="32">"they make a modern virtue out of the holiday need, and transfer their election campaign largely into the internet."</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the president Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners go on search for traces of native voters among the vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvts with a houseboat through the mecklenburgisches lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">"your impression:" "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 rehabilitation: restaurants suffer under blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is restructured, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30am and end up at 8pm, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty much," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the receipt will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work, such as when it comes to the establishment of accommodation arrangements."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been wandered to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Evasion through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there have been some significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Florian King, responsible for the administrative management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping things were looking for and rather familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the franchisement of some trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality demanded to strengthen the vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant overrides," says King, who made himself informed of the situation on the spot. "</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest one was on the road at 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue breakthroughs allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the end customer, i.e. for other companies, have little consequences for the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" no more slight drop "but also states that, of course," the race is missing. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most bagged are the restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants" hit hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We need to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"at" "far more than 50 per cent", "the revenue losses date back to" "far over 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The road marking started its operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation with the hint, the restaurant otherwise benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it also has to bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where such a little more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he points to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the fact that other regulars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive out, it is also somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his trunk-cap returns to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-term history."</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly being screwed in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">"after the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick safety package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the sermon.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not challenge anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other additional points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am also involved in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as the Minister of the Interior, however, he was on results and at a" recoverable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But that's all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some things have already been announced, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière will start a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="18">He still considers this to be reasonable and doesn't demand anything that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">They partly have it in themselves: he is planning screening procedures for deportations and more possibilities for imprisonment of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones in advance and expose social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the event of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them also seem inexhorted and leaves unanswered questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the Ansbach and Wuerzburg assassins were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"moreover, in view of the high number of refugees, many people worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that profoundly occupied people, could not be cluttered even in election campaign times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The focus is on inner security.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are competitions."</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly gaining ground in the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high rise between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garrisky dispute over the facilities of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the head of the department also demand a Burka ban and a return from double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling with conciliatory tones here too.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't think of a return from a double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have limited the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To replenish it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a Burka ban, he has constitutional objections."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutionally unconstitutional at all corners and whether it is actually" reasonable "for the coalition partner, must first show itself."</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot of things to do for dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">"however, the SPD is also trying to defend itself on the issue of internal security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hasten to the comment section, to sow it under the pseudonym of a male middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much-discussed rebirth of records is not a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely target group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soho I wear a modest gray suit and run wild, before I stop, hold my hands and say something bumpy like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic plate specials."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I wrote by Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early seventies that appeared when I was 11 or 12."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe, people who heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people generally have been discharged to their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a given age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that keep happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is the case with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people."</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flirts from a panel."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not listened to them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while crossing a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only came here recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-class."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates, has a colourful audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women middle-aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesize and sexbepacked pop instead of experimental jazz, it's good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but nailing psychological trauma is hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping tour than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she doesn't earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives with a dearded sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to wear jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls, who are grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that gives most for luxury items such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research has shown that YouGov's results vote, they don't take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with security not with strolling through panels of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rages over the shoulders of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to buy 72 temporary stores in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, sell barber services or sell simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Calais prefecture has argued that these places should be torn down, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, which could provide a fire and health risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also suggested that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the" "Prefecture of Calais" "were absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café in the camp, which is in common use and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle-bearing living has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-year rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis on Thursday evening when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji given a master class in handling, side-stitching, back-back, linear and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiad medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall for them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, under Ryan they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lose only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let the attack GBs bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co., as if you were running in driving busses. the World Series winners went to top 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau frosted in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a splendid Tackle von Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jehoiasa Veremalua sent a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presumes by further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji being born to play the 7, while GB is still learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through to a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinsulan whose fans sang, flags piped and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked crushing into the lawn."</seg>
<seg id="28">"earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a narrow semi-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the bucks up in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that wants what is to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard drives that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she moved to the second Olympiagold in a second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.000 unvarnished commitment, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference, and nobody knew whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning to talk a little more than anything else, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking for something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want a fireworks, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about the future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic Champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green energy extraction are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the release of the renewable energy conversion in the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry," said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ). "</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we finally managed to reach.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent is applied."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a particular significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" "Steel is Future", "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emissions trading law, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "said IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry has suffered under overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of products threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers introduce price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have accumulated."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have been stagnating again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers are cautious in July."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Economic Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a brief increase in May, the quantity produced now went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production is up by two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more vivid, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs on a regular basis do not get out of the doll as quickly as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia patients dismiss in long-standing events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir too.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who listens to when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors" choir, one can simply join. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"those who want to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="3">"to their surprise, the mistrust also did not let the males cold - however they always behaved in contrast to the females always the same."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of pathogen of kittens on the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they respond by ten percent faster to Laute von Kätzchen, who find themselves in great need, as scientists have found out from the veterinary university and the Hannover Medical School (MHH)."</seg>
<seg id="6">Males react even to the calls of kittens - however always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"apparently the acoustic differences between the mistrust of less and strongly aroused young animals are either not perceptible or not of importance," "said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH."</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens scream differ with the urgency of their neediness."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight female kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">"they were played for a call of small ones, which were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers maintain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had not had their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," "said Konerding."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they turned around faster to the loudspeaker, when the loop of the very rainy kittens was playing."</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "said the biologist."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noise."</seg>

<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so Schnöll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin, initially on Thursday evening, had exploded two bombs."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, Thai nationals were killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two blasting heads went up again, and another person was killed according to the authorities."</seg>

<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee to journalists Friday morning. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express himself to possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist movement or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesperson in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by enemies of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the authorities would have received secret evidence for imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but they were not informed of the exact date and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is lying behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police ordered their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"after the bombastic explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its homepage to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need for any necessary travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were cancelled a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution executed by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement of economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, helped itself to bring the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"just one year ago, in Bangkok, a popular Hindu shrine was killed 20 people, most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not have any knowledge."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweighted float from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">"quickly, the first nicknames made the round."</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel des Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the English boulevard" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "was funny about him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m free-style, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run ensured media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when he had to compete alone in a race over 100 meters of free-standing."</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a higher calculation, the wastewater award in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the district office Kulmbach, Unterdeckungen had been established for these sewage plants."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal principles, the market of Kazendorf is required to operate the plants cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fees are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Head of Administration, Herbert Schmidt presented the panel, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater treatment of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overlappings and undercover from the previous calendar period may also be offset."</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt stated that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenditures, the underlying calculation of all three plants was not least incurred due to their age of refurbishment and repair."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for world thigh, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water system Azendorf because of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be evacuated, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses contributed to the continued care and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which are still clearly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment the expenses for operation and maintenance were completely overflowed in the three plants.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large-scale entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spared."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to be precarious in the long run, particularly as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment association can not be expanded because it is a matter of deficit."</seg>

<seg id="2">"snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>

<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are blunt, standalone tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in the past, snapchat filters have critiqued criticism in which they were accused of promoting either black face or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darker cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellowish. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage was widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant to pay homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of injurious clichés."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it allowed the actual states on site to report in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Preliminary Report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the military committees, intelligence committees and military budget commites, reports of great dissatisfaction under Central Command, intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Intelligence information generated by high-level CentCom commanders typically marked a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services. "a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The CentCom leadership errors extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence indicating that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to shut down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigations will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, the CentCom reports are being conducted by the Secretary General of the Defense Department."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom encircled an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest ranking Demokrat, member of the Adam B. Ship House of Representatives, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," shamed the morality among analysts and gave too little room for dissenting opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats agreed not to have found any evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were admitted to Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the accusations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"critics concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall between more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush did not foresee only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, stating that the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"CentCom's damn commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed winner will take a little longer from the strong Dutchman who will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising confusion due to their success story, four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 squares."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she wasn't able to qualify for the cades.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "Bam said."</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work place in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to complete the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a back cover from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India went into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and hit the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the US, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had a goal in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are steady and inescapable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow guard to the swimmers to a gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leopoly or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a womens swarm with dimples, could well have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not highlight any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke swim and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I want to make a modest argument for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparingly perceived that many of them, I asked, did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the jumping competition and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a Clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending bouncing - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, they are rated according to the execution, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists need to move forward in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the finish line or the output wall, but also another high goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympic-record."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatiguing when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline inginger is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the spruce and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed, Mr Dooley expects his new fan base to come to the air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia stumbled upon the violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say umpteen protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed on umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa, and its stability is appreciated by the west."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restrained, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following an extensive election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are afraid that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden that have been defeated more or less in recent years could use turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness gradually explode after years of debiting under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming increasingly common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered so much to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, Amharas, who are predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," said Muller Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who constitute about 6 percent of the population, dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had until his death a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, coming from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which were apparently pledged by the government according to the statements of analysts, and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan town, managed by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Drones flights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, attacking his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the Islamic State terrorist group, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, to explain to the peculiar position that he might not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump agreed on Thursday's claim and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism jumped down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling changes."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" Of course, I thought the sarcastic. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," "clarify" "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone since his survey results have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to not excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, had great difficulty in defending the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it rear-brokers, completely false, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around and being taken against him on each of his words."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the poor, miserable" TV experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't." "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water tortoise soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on this day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while bricks were told in their book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacking, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," Brickman said. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been placed in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pates for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "paints the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense topic," "Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tight as the new budget: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became a staple food, the Kasserole as a" "wonderful way to recycle food residues," "noted Ziegelman, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Quirky mixes have been tried out because a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction prevails over taste or even healthy kitchen expertise.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to midday," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "it was surreal." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the family recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"like never before or since, housekeeping - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household politicians "and the challenge of transforming pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historic treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">"especially tasty are the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-food-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while publicly commending the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he served as the millions-heavy man of the world to whom he became."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-arks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's hair only gets offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark floats along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it counts, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Greenland hai, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Greenland's hair is stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-arks are difficult to observe, finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-winding speed they measured, when they stopped six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may hunt for sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream, and search for cadaver, which torates from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland-arks, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest is 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon-14 method the lenticular core of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons-seeking larger quantities of this radioactive carbon trapped in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres in length, the lenticular core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it could have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland-arks had normal carbon-14-amounts in their lenticular core, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark, while the record shark with 502 centimetres was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined 156 years ago, Greenland's hair with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be world record for vertebrates currently.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such Methusaleme live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest his resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Hillary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015, which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in 2015 the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in speech honoraries; former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</seg>

<seg id="11">"on Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump special adviser, said CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before tax inspections were not finished."</seg>
<seg id="12">"critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets, donations for charitable organisations, his forms of business and various other connections, especially with Russia."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last evening in the men's team-Sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had turned into Eigen.</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships, despite the arrival of Hoys."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the qualification round, Kenny, Kenny - who prevailed four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner won an Olympic tournament in the qualification laps, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindu went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make myself a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up an Olympic board in the final round and the world champions defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels like all the UK flags on the grandstand as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part next to the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London 2012, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had argued yesterday with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK Team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"dramas took place in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of Sesto and Mobbingproposals as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of Portland melt-up due to cancellation of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria in the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy scheduled for 20 years is running in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the enamel consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry Melting, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting mill with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force from November 2016 onwards."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from that point onwards, AGL assumes that contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual subscription amounting to $187 million in" expectation of termination. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the enamel or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have come into force from November this year even though there is still a statement on why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn due to the poor economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and a total of 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both systems disappear from the market it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, that wouldn't be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just keeping up with the Kardashians like?), scanned reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz Onkel and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché story almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence" "You thought we should forget you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a playsite at 8am in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014, but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still going through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, the modeled "as" models that are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation, falls under the previous category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapshot video (even if everything is applicable to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always a bit strained."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around the face seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters are selling images of themselves on their paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator came to the market 20 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather dusty."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory at the beginning was eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 Communicator came to the stores exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, lovers can buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible by HTML-Browser, albeit agonizing slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns" cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled. "</seg>

<seg id="1">England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">"Heathrow will not only bring about renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrow, as well as in 2012 in London when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and foreign companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expansion Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the doubters had been wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong at Heathrow."</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any asked question."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in fun growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the whole of the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years as a result of the world's best airport terminal, built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to turn this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"for companies that earn money with online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blockage are the same as a" cat and mouse game "according to one of the software manufacturers."</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop site would change coding on its advertisements in order to make it harder to recognise the recognition of which part of the advertising page is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" "this kind of Hin-and-Her-battle between the present Open Source Community and the Shift has been underway since the invention of ad lockers," "and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how worrying indicators for the industry have become.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display-lockers; almost four times as much in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion active users, who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising generates 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks."</seg>

<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs has a large share of revenues so that Facebook appears to be an investment of such a step as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its" "advertising preferences" "to give people more control over them."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be more worrying, because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"for the users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," "said a Facebook speaker in an email message."</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday overcame a presumed suicide of several cars on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" "in an act of despair" "on the road and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman wanted to kill herself at the age of 49, which was carried over by several vehicles, including a truck."</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said these and any witnesses of the incident call on to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases where a person in the dark ran on the highway, it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was mentioned in the newspaper."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of Venus exposed its day-side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought of planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was supposedly inhabited, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and their water vapour has been blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen discharge, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently attacking companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware specialists Malwarebytes below 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the casualties willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential for erasing ransom is considerably higher than for private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," says Malwarebytes director Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"private users were only the target, but the change to company attacks occurred over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for unmodified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the receivables of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users find the personal photo-database on the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of turnover through ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop the business operation completely, in one case, people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker on the other hand know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decode example files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and when private businessmen are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data back unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the so-called malware kits were created by buying malware, counseling and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackouts are then looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and various causes may be underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping up and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but what one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, so a single and diaphragm disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel, says just the passing through."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychic or behavioural factors can be put behind it, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare that sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is particularly frequent in depression," says Weber. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors imply each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a disc failure, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to say hello to everyday problems and worries."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturb the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you are not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, you should go to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietz, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, you should contact the family doctor if you suffer from sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to bed or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of sickness-like fatigue, sleep-converters or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fiord."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fié."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after covering, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a antennae at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera shows the sleeping ends at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of interlocking screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"she doesn't sleep too long in bed, not to sleep on the day, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a remnant of cobblestones: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like the first sight, but the police is one of the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a frescoed kindergarten and a biolade."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"opposite a Lidl, which will soon be torn down, will be built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"articles about this" trendy city district, "such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, are, however, favored by burning cars in the last few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, in the meantime the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, police patrolled out parts of the street with 30 to 40 officials and three men on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers departed from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late."</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, are particularly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wishes to get a majority of police protection from the vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police arise between the occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain, in the East of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class district, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police command in a real road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them against casted panes or freshly painted facades, which have been discarded with colored bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words "Left Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: criminal offences such as injury to the body are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences make tangible damages, which tend to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"when it comes to violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who were certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer moved into the Rigaer Strasse - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was also so important that the local residents got back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the solitude of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"however, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former construction sites that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well drunk," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can't approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out people who are annoyed about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new containers are available in the Wasenstraße"</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district council office to the commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, the administration does not find private homes."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work, so it is necessary to rely on private housing," says Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, community dwellings need to be emptied, as it is called so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frayed or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity does not only mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"thus, administration and volunteers are also jumping here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also problem cases, says customer honestly," "people with whom nothing works." "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already an "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer clearly, "" what some may call naive "." "</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitized."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would bring them back completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they have always in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the politicians are afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site helpers."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the certificates are already at full capacity to integrate the existing people wisely.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently there are about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
