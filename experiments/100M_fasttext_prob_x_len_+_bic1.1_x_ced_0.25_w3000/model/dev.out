Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the encounter , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continued settlement construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the fores@@ eeable future election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor asked to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was scor@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said that they were happy about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty encompasses 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations about problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously requested the Delta State University for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , worked so hard for the Lamb , would not be a guarantee for an automatic approach to a job as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 Lamb opened his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he holds a doc@@ torate in education in spring .
&quot; one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ time friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , 40 and living in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago . &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , his daughter writes and sings its own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for several companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5th for the last time Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic@@ ism in front of a sp@@ her@@ ical audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the mess and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his br@@ otherhood and student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch vi@@ gil , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb had made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb had called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas @-@ season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is planning to recru@@ it 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers have been hired during Christmas 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with interviews and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and an arm length of it being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the Council &apos;s meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; Ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
&quot; 8 Survey results , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nomin@@ ee .
&quot; experts emphasize that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom none of them won a single state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa revealed last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten say they would &quot; &quot; anno@@ y &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see the tem@@ per &apos;s tem@@ per as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first national state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their guard @-@ hats , Repub@@ lican voters hold tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who is most likely to win GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four out of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry won the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; however , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P constitu@@ ents look at Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field will likely contribute to trun@@ ks management , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly entr@@ en@@ ched their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their opinion are twice as frequent for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans is kept away from the Repub@@ lican party and damaging the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l from Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , there will be Donald Tr@@ ump as well . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing up to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son are now eliminated about half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , is the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a home roof@@ ed house costs € 7@@ 3.@@ 300 . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter is the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ler has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in sw@@ inging heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here for an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ chet in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze launched a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off match in the Champions League in the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ edness ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; Müller received kind assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto at the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership , who made a shot of the World Champion thought out as flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; said Bayern captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich &apos;s word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed presentation without gl@@ itter@@ ing .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund participated ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European elections with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts but often too innocent of works .
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by game shift on left @-@ sour Douglas Costa , which rarely passed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunity in half one .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms , Ide@@ a Brown struck the pol@@ l &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct tak@@ eover , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto had par@@ ted with his knee ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved into their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could place needle @-@ stit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but Manuel Neu@@ er , a door@@ keeper , was not allowed to leave . &quot;
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ a on the Lat@@ te ( 56 ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center , next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final qualifying session , &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer , &quot; who wants to do something else out of it , that &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 76 . ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
&quot; before the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavarian fans in their audience @-@ block prov@@ okes the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with sticks against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : when doing away , the risk decreases rapidly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international team of researchers , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , increasing the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
&quot; the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent g@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could , however , reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , explained the author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become a non @-@ smo@@ ker , Professor H@@ einer Boeing of the DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings it also leads to good dental health down to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population is affected by tooth@@ lessness in the age of 65 to 74 years , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter remains of late anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on the Rhine .
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , museum manager Marcus Trier was said on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ology of Natural Heritage . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now finding something . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with some 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured from freight train
&quot; after a young woman is unhappy at the train station in the Gei@@ ste@@ er@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for help . &quot;
&quot; early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ pm , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the train station and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by recording the train , she carried the most serious injuries to it according to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated to hospital at the spot and taken to hospital by rescue workers .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal track crossing of the young woman , the intermedi@@ ary officials do not find any evidence . &quot;
the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by come from Lin@@ der@@ ner Railway , Ziegel@@ straße , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;
&quot; information about the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock , and the free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station can be given . &quot;
European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning is much more traditional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US free trade talks .
the German government announced its support .
&quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to come into being with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should have equal parts from the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot;
a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , a possibility of obj@@ ections to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , over which companies can drive damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans as great progress . &quot;
the Commission took into account the key points that the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economic activities of the economy through too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; just eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dated fol@@ ks@@ y recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places he always draws on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states should be followed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot;
exu@@ ber@@ antly on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any list of the most influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experim@@ entation , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic offset . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the smaller clubs have long since desc@@ ended , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark district of Hamburg More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs here , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become much more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without judging a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; plate in essence . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens is a modest addition to an en@@ core , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and eventually deterior@@ ates under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire was eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is said to have his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , the decision of the Labour leader has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and focuses on several stories stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesman said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Program , he advised the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour Sh@@ ould make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow worker minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory boss over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another politi@@ cian , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will be subjected to both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the dispute with re@@ tain@@ ers , and instead of focusing on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle will represent the shadow of economic ministers if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also expressed the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , in order to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy Ju@@ dy Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rose sharply due to data showing an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s mission . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and most recent assessment of the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were above encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of his strategy of reducing debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares in the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster presents Lebanese on potato ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and in the potato don@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ hay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the wording &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , revol@@ ves around his shop . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has now been submitted to the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts its resili@@ ence campaign to combat al@@ di@@ -
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a resili@@ ence campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell illustrated tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler carries out its annual investors strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut some five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and depri@@ ve all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA &apos;s retailer could lose 360 $ million in sales per year and by cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts of a high fixed cost base met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost some 13 million dollars before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash gains market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan discovered that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business fall 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , falling 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which provides about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has been dropping by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operative debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retail dealers in improving their stores by growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ i and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious argument of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery skill game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after crashing down a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly &apos;s Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite busy is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was pulled into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everybody , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish the team to concentrate fully on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and controlled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a No Man &apos;s land and responded to Serbian officials with ou@@ trage .
&quot; the people fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a stre@@ ak on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian labour police . &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations block to no common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who seek refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would take up more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not set its hopes for the imminent action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation , which was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , meanwhile said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having stopped a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ins@@ em@@ ats were used in the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and became the entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sts that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency state , &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the action of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to get there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 succeeded in getting involved , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to lead a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains her face against ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in prim@@ aries ( 58 per cent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ o@@ oned for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot;
Clinton has a big lead in women and moder@@ ates but these projections have less@@ ened .
&quot; their support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders will only be back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has , however , still a major advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage for the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it , because it is the candidate . &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their prime candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the ability to choose will also be cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , bi@@ ds are at the top . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; twenty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election , but this figure dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these election poll@@ s stands out as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in the election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities include Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic voters of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters did not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be asked as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of ten who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; but Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , received good notes on leadership . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush fit best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey is now om@@ itted , and others dramatically lose halt &quot;
the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and was sur@@ passing Tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican constitu@@ ents with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place . &quot;
the fault mar@@ row at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; overlooking a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some stra@@ in@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps belief . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a I@@ owa campaign . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holiday@@ makers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student passed a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student was handed over to five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which had contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was loaded with attached eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; finally , Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , &quot; &quot; said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Police Chief of Police . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force . &quot;
&quot; many families have been destroyed by the br@@ ass@@ les of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died of the ch@@ ic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended charges for the third degree for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of false attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the domestic trip will fall , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that all the fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an interest rate increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset @-@ income varies from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects dela@@ ying the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is mostly in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gies at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , at 118 rate increases since 1950 only nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the indications of Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants gr@@ asp@@ ed the F@@ ed interest rate all year round , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading only gives a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the development cycles of 1950 up to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipated interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields are immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a closer kn@@ itting between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , Jones means that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , lending has increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and large part , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively . &quot;
debt is a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts have different opinions about how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says member of parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for his &quot; &quot; sil@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to the broadcast The Voice , saying that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , says a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private tran@@ smit@@ ters do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works , I think really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work was needed to engage audiences than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports , to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP , Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; if the next time there is a stre@@ ak of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee @-@ sellers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose on slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the record in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then this has developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G @-@ selling index to the Guardian . &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyer started making purchases with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is going to swing , and we may see that growth will be reduced . &quot;
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers keep their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites fell off .
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers won because of bar@@ gains , could stop purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spent over £ 1 online at £ 5 .
&quot; with some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims at the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse partly of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the dead who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ at . &quot;
&quot; filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay homage to their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed down a san@@ ction over the construction company of bin Laden because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
the bodies of 29 people killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
&quot; among the deaths Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; king Sal@@ man said today , the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , falling into an inner courtyard of the big mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the cranes , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger building projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a wandering son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same sum of permanently wounded .
other publishers will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
&quot; this leads to the opening of 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people . &quot;
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is alleged that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople who carry out their work in their home
&quot; if you are skill@@ ful using a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; because British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , the boss of the company is behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 additional scre@@ wing shops that are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and close up to 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate with the staff . &quot;
she said it was necessary to adapt to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .

officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ warding . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for office abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that the accused were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he bu@@ ys the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point of time an impairment was created . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials would have charged only expense damages and the sports club for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and in whom they invested a lot of time and money , out of the debt - the Passi@@ va bil@@ led around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : &quot; do we continue or lock the club , &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread@@ making profession of the finance office . &quot;
&quot; with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have put money in order to secure our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the confis@@ cation . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses compens@@ ations had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 in case of financial success . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 onwards , when a plus has been on the account . &quot;
&quot; as a result , flat @-@ rate and non @-@ detailed bookings also appeared , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books jointly administered the two accused , the second accused said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial sponsor@@ ship , important is only the freedom of the debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigation for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club account . &quot;
&quot; that was , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second accused , and according to his testimony the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; after that , the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time . &quot;
then he said he believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed that the function@@ ary justified himself .
this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; claims repar@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never obtained a cent salary , he merely calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to the club , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not be presented to the defend@@ ants .
&quot; they were no longer kept up after an operational check , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
&quot; the second accused , too , had taken the mil@@ eage . &quot;
&quot; he explained in his statement , that all the exercises are made in cash . he explained in his statement from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main hearing continues on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the computer giant will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the Stell@@ ites at the US @-@ Compu@@ Tr@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around USD 2.@@ 7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , grown with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto , currently spl@@ its up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , last recently to the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; in this way , revenue declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , mostly be rejected by rejection : 54 percent said , however , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
61 percent positive that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in co @-@ operation with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed reject , 20 percent would be responsible for that . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : demo@@ lition of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; on the Serbian border , the Hungarian police used tear gas and water cann@@ on against several hundred refugees . &quot;
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported to us by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind the police , a police line was formed and a water gun was ready behind the polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially set up a pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
&quot; in doing so , the group was dissolved . &quot;
the refugees have now declined slightly .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas scre@@ amed .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
also the spokesman of the Serbian police suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is observed when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior associate at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death shock at Delta State University left behind ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and , &quot; &quot; he could not do it , &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
and said he shot someone and killed someone .
&quot; lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre , that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I just wanted to undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were surrounded by him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He does not go to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University , such as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website . &quot;

&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa plans a major expansion of the Group .
&quot; as a result , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization . &quot;

&quot; among other things , there will be no more management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ speed airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .

&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left external defender to cry and would exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; Mr van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has very hard and then fantastic plays , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger . &quot;

&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a burst when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in another direction so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know what it feels like , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph where Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead returns a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text submitted by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street speaker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ on &apos;s employees , but there were no immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t exclude a down@@ turn .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the UK Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the run of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he kno@@ cks out further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not deliver such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales enters and he is a drummer I treasure .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would yield an extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , showed up and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty man has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may have not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he came up as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred of us immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punching , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the train@@ ee staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ den , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test matches could be a master @-@ coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not deployed in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you need to remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made to light hearted .
the Bre@@ x@@ it bearing ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Great Britain from the EU ) could gain allow@@ ances when the economy goes into a dol@@ drums by 2017

&quot; my European friend , who wants an open @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , before it looks bad for her , like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a verbal force .
&quot; Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will be pulled out of a leg to help the British , whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process is presum@@ ed to be my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press , but were not supported in 1975 by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak in remember@@ ing Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his rever@@ ence , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bla@@ ir actually thought about her , but noticed that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had adopted the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly tap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s and today .
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position towards Europe - I just press it out - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ac@@ b@@ stoff tendencies and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but fighting to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their clause on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins is sure to think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not run a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government on power , which was reminded by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum at the start of Monday . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze Report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with compounds to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers questioned the intensity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; on which he explained his most important conclusion .
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports beforehand by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes @-@ champi@@ ons , some of which also include an industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco leadership of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ ers &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damage to most products in most of the criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there have been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Prof. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being near P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison with this , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear presentation of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ board says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; former Chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er- and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square so@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the House of the House of Communications as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the greatest possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , of course it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ er- is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give that again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ er@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their seemingly holy missions for the justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course you all think that you get a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check , educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission . &quot;
&quot; he said , little by BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada for example , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos; Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; th@@ read@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically altered the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ orized ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultras@@ onic to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ h ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired location in the brain in an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and thus can be sent into the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which was around the advertising for the trade fair - through a laying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence halls range from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to smile : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken a sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were ign@@ elled and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
&quot; people often transform themselves into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and put on their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes through che@@ eks .
&quot; since you start at the climax of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked a little . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people sleeping when they kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk @-@ owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; they should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my floor asked her neighbours if it &apos;s something that makes them a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future married couple , go to them , separate them and then see them every day and perhaps witness how they out@@ pass all common friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your under@@ belly a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good coup is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Sol@@ di@@ ers , Low @-@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of the corner .
&quot; for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the poor @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot;

thousands of refugees are forced to push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Mark Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he is building town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a large part .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough living space over the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ bert : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are sleeping in blocks of flats .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs . &quot;
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; legally , I have correctly dra@@ gged my project . &quot;
especially complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is no room for that .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not correct .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : true , however : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we built luxury flats , which can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and good job even today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack returns or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates , and it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is completed . &quot;

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only a motto in the fight for World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup runner turned into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore prior to the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve season races so far , as well as taking the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot;
2009 and last year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; for days , a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago and has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke . &quot;
&quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which accommod@@ ated Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to include chess players , who cannot afford to pay the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and Anton@@ ist Alten@@ zentrum have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition , you can also participate in courses there . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there .
&quot; from now on , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services provided by the health and nursing offices . &quot;
&quot; for years now , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that many families are often left alone . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , there are endless questions . &quot;
&quot; not in@@ frequently many of the funds are not used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ine and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ di stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders , particularly in the demographic change . &quot;
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure essential in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; furthermore , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office devoted itself to the club membership : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
&quot; the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 . &quot;
Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg against Wu@@ erz@@ burg Ki@@ ckers on 6 October
&quot; now it is official : since the date for the game FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg was not yet established for the game FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg against the third @-@ party Würzburg Ki@@ ckers , the 6th October was now set as an appointment . &quot;
the meeting of FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg in the eighth @-@ fin@@ als of the Bay@@ erische Theater@@ tot@@ op@@ ok@@ als against the third @-@ party FC Wu@@ erz@@ burg Ki@@ ckers has now been terminated .

&quot; we are glad that we now know when the game is going on stage , now we have planning security , &quot; &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z Hü@@ mmer , who also points to the now started ticket sales . &quot;
it is something special for our team to play against a third party .
&quot; we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because flood lights have a special appeal . &quot;
in the round of the last 16 teams the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg attracted 1st FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the region@@ al@@ gi@@ sts 1 . FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus will lose an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as mentioned in the Foreign Office . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the eigh@@ ties , he was entrusted with the establishment of the treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , he did not admit it . &quot;
&quot; meadow had just cut off his hair in the downtown of Bremen , when he saw a parking space watch@@ ful looking out for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the public prosec@@ utor accused him of having insul@@ ted the public , and threw her the fine fine in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in Bremen , the alle@@ gations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only after that I decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot;

men beat 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ oral : Friday evening , at about 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a rup@@ ture of the nose and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
&quot; under the help of a pun@@ cture , one re@@ charges the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
&quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue day description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters large .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ enh@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in half a position to his successor during the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the office on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l years ago , who is currently studying their specialist training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so , I just called it . &quot;
the couple Mu@@ eller liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also seems to be his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so they agreed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice . &quot;
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several doctors offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DRC &apos;s willingness to take care of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the office will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen operates as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) has specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ent EC@@ Gs and need a more speaking room .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers receive a supplement of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros in the context of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continues to be continued , &quot; stresses Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann &apos;s Mayor . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients arrive in the field of field breaks every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 500 in North German average practice . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another dental practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Rocky in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
anyone who visits Müller &apos;s consultation hour also looks especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
&quot; with their farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years there . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ville re@@ members a smile . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she already felt a little melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients still , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband re@@ plen@@ ishes : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also lifted to our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to that .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can also do so &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the care and safety of the people .
&quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia is , by contrast , already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , the Slov@@ ene wants to not shut down its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fulfil his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly making police vehicles in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which have previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , would agree on Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; we can neither , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , and in the course of the day further bus@@ ses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the passengers were on the road all night long , from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , the postpon@@ ement of the so @-@ called Balkans @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ located route . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then the EU partners have consistently testified to the country as to the standard of border controls .
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be a very high influ@@ x of refugees at this time .
&quot; it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have listened to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having provided an insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der transactions are to be made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused took place in the case .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people get their concerns , some quick steps , partly cozy stroll . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the streets .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large panels each with the heading &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite faced with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and discussions like the volunteers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously get to chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffering &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then proceed . &quot;
&quot; again and again , there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim plant , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the boards is understandable , however , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped people to open up . &quot;
an app@@ rais@@ al which An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid is sharing .
the funeral and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce was looking for volunteers with an appeal , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , hold it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower rate of view is , despite the price increases , which are on average 4.@@ 9 percent and effective January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ ve transports of heavy and large packages , which will be collected in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase over the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company gains &quot; solid income , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
&quot; six of the analysts demanded $ 12,@@ 23 billion . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher operating costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;

&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the close short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the economic data show that it grows well , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already @-@ si@@ ghted F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification for continuing to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what makes the financial market uns@@ ett@@ led .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the impact by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy continues to uph@@ old the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level , which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now around 10 % below the pole of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influences the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in the decision @-@ making process technically . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; mere reference from the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; varn@@ ishing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for an increase in interest , quoted Dec@@ ision in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia has led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rates by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; not@@ withstanding the limited appreci@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives did undo these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aside aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate foundation . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which also sells to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the walks . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the till@@ s and has various pick @-@ up options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and local Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even fry on request for you . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the involvement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people supporting un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
&quot; among them , Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them . &quot;
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 lessons .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole thing is different than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazilian Student Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding nutrition
&quot; the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good food is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies , who su@@ ck on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the Bern@@ ried Municipal Council approved the contract for the EUR 2.3 million gym@@ nasi@@ um .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ n@@ astic structure at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : during the most recent municipal council session , the completed building contract was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the committee had decided to submit an application to a legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid building plan . &quot;
&quot; with the exception , it was permitted for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ partial First and roof@@ top roof &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants is : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; it was , in turn , about the a@@ version prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the plan of the building permit no &quot; exceptions &quot; regarding the ti@@ lt - although Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s municipal council is generally more restric@@ tive when it comes to liber@@ ating proposals . &quot;
&quot; however , there is no recur@@ rent project in gym@@ n@@ astic construction : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the same time , some 2.3 million euros have been estimated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes promotion .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be presented to the Federal Council Office for review . &quot;
P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Clinic moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of the staff moved from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; this is what the surprising plans of the hospital in Land@@ kreis , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirm . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 staff at the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital would continue to work . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ on@@ gau with fishermen and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who do not travel to Sch@@ on@@ gau are to be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner White . &quot;
the staff were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and change his team to Sch@@ on@@ gau . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
&quot; f@@ isher with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ ap@@ ark , which still has more than 35 beds , shall be closed in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this until 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner White could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ time psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer on the Qu@@ asi reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positively and very understand@@ ably &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favorite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the bad@@ ener at Bh@@ c moved a painful defeat and made a good fortune there . &quot;
Jag@@ ie case with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police reported . &quot;
after a shot @-@ off a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in the interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence since Saturday .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be a suspect , according to the fact that he was indic@@ ted and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
&quot; when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities reported to the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the dead bodies in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death . &quot;
the further investigation is intended to shed light on the circum@@ stance of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a study on behalf of the Con@@ federation Con@@ federation &quot; Social Building Construction . &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation facility . &quot;
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; about 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compla@@ ined . &quot;
many professional people therefore lived in large cities in an emergency room in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willing to stay longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the noise on the housing market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic income tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee dwell@@ ings of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been rec@@ alled on Monday night with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; after Hungary , practically no passing through , more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the de@@ position of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been forced to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after arriving , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not run on border guards . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border stri@@ pe poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws are not@@ ing the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been accepted on Tuesday in the new &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicant are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees there . &quot;
&quot; practically , however , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported back there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
barrier screens were broken down and one of the shooting camps in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves to the purpose of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants , however , were still in the country in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly hit foot . &quot;
&quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; across the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy on Sunday after the bridge festival , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance to the Zel@@ ts , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to catch the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we did not even sell the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not allow himself to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire department .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from one ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u in order to stop at the short notice that rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was set off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbors was soci@@ able on Sunday , on Sunday before a two @-@ leg movement - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly supported the Hungarian government &apos;s position in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; the refugees will also have to realize that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; that they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters &quot;
&quot; with the introduction of refugees , Konrad has to deal with all his hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the first reception centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees , which came to Austria on Monday , was also carried out without a big fuss , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , still 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the provincial govern@@ ors , he has already held talks . &quot;
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s good , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that district len@@ ders have to comply with a certain height of the towel holder or size of the sky@@ light . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; should apply . &quot;
&quot; contrary to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in placing an accommodation than Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the republic as they explained .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
&quot; up to now , our own quest for quot@@ as has not yet been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the approval . &quot;
Linz demands a better distribution
&quot; for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties are currently unable to submit these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
the head of the city has been critic@@ ised for the breakdown of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not locked off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ ded further proceedings in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; however , those seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria now also carries out controls on its borders , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he can imagine investing in startup companies in the New Shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on to acquire some of them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the Arctic
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta Br@@ ing wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking long about whether I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most of all , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the subject with last safety . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called &quot; &quot; An@@ ders &quot; . &quot; &quot;
some people also associate with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
&quot; whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , regards journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy , the candidate for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire date back . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ ur is a concept for many in the wine @-@ tasting village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is over -@@ zig facets with it is related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ stadt rider Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ stadt filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , beside Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of hearts there .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in High German : the licens@@ or , she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the property group were the first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once was he@@ wn off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the follow @-@ up .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz . &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather distance , &quot; &quot; he is always so broken . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the pension econom@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stadt , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which generally arrived well . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who saw the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA awakening interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ine breakfast show was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts to which Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n belonged . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the state seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 on average reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September , Sun@@ rise has risen to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today with 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ael Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe resulted in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 5 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half an hour on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; on average 6@@ 20,000 Hot @-@ Se@@ at . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that the hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.@@ m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute it didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should receive the last rose ? &quot; could her answers become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet , so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay told her that last week the house visit made it clear that Wood &apos;s &quot; One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood ought to choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten days on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a tie , as did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converter during his first punch return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the mill before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly confirmed Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a punch that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

the Free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were not corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get dis@@ gra@@ dations in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the Free elec@@ torate &apos;s state parliament postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the wars in Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the Free voters away as soon as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need uniform federal standards throughout Germany . &quot;
&quot; Bayern moves away , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long standing burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; &quot; Inter@@ mediate plus &quot; , &quot; where an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years is tested . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W leader . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
fixed Wall Street helps Da@@ x on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits following a wide @-@ ranging and nervous trade history .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a festive opening of the US stock exchanges caused a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the financial index of the euro@@ zone declined by 1,@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits were also boo@@ sted by trading posts in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Sustainability Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many stock markets reck@@ on that the markets will take place until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big decline of the fut@@ ures on this Friday .
the debate around the loads from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has temporarily de@@ pressed the shares of RW@@ E at a record low and also left deep traces in E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros for provisions . &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Da@@ x , Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors presented little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; in this context , investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the automotive market should be paid out . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were re @-@ tuned than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the official documents of the Daimler and BMW buses were 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on return of listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the pension index re@@ ared by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro decreased to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon .
&quot; at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar therefore cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district cler@@ k , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber shells , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled over centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for marketing the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete proposals yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter site in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;

the investor &apos;s question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;

project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday resort on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , greeted , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday resort near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which submitted to investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends met with the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; for months , this project has been in discussion for some ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; fierce reactions among hor@@ se@@ power owners who came to the meeting , called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ gun that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus@@ loads to make it worth it , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the development plans were also variable . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling Don@@ ations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to aid $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , who are to help thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations , up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / &quot; er@@ eli@@ ef , will be doubled to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many refugees fle@@ eing from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality figures require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; under those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition dissolved completely and 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved only at one percent and in some cases with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the guest rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , and achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.2 kg ) and marked a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a subject that is increasingly paying attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech to the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries is ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama also praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tackl@@ ing the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he enforced violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of the use of hand @-@ made disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , who swallow strongly alcoholic hand @-@ dis@@ infection products , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years , the toxic control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive to children . &quot;
hand @-@ made disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , few sp@@ urs can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four spra@@ yers from after straw@@ berry fragrance inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; physicians monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , certain disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police considered the sec@@ ret@@ ched plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll turn things around , swe@@ ars by Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian CEO sw@@ or to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and subsequent ex@@ cre@@ ment from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , now with five points ahead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
&quot; we feel that exactly , but we have to go on . &quot;
&quot; we really need Celtic support , because that makes the players better . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the UK overall .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 between May and July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the figure of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew nearer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places available , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen in order to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he went to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t @-@ plu@@ cking rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat down on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb rise in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and may make people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but now I &apos;ve arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on my leg .
it could have been so last night .
&quot; it would have been like yesterday all day , which was also the case . &quot;
but it had it so on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after flight of driver
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver @-@ flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said that the car driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man came from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged on account of the driver &apos;s flight and assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight against ri@@ vals for alle@@ gations of w@@ rest@@ ling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost cover@@ t note to the Storm Team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criti@@ ques of two leading trainers in his team voice him confident , as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this always emerges again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a bull@@ sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and not points anything exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail for drug addic@@ ts &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly have a life sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a possibly lifel@@ ong penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security , in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
&quot; during a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks participated in a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn to the left at the last moment , as the police reported . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ ture ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; the result was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophil@@ es to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept and was logged into an online mess@@ aging service by which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ erts her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and found &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used concepts for the search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching was done on the computer by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
after his talks with the unknown person he was asked who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the act of indictment , to have accepted in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not to appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers made fear of discovery and arrest more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said . &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn along the river Inn Inn since Tuesday .
they were walking over bridges and st@@ ow@@ ls to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; according to Federal Police reports , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison to the week &apos;s start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 am , said a spokesman in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm clouds in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently chann@@ elled into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , in the Black Forest , the Schwä@@ bische Al@@ b and at the bottom se@@ abed with arches of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun rises again for a long time . &quot;
the crowd makes it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , especially in the compact cars , the compact cars are particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : roughly 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( Public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be among the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is entering the VW Golf competition , starting at 17 650 euros , below the biggest competitor VW Golf . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sent the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e will only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and under@@ lined sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in trade , he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan collector wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will have a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will start in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger placed his hand at the front end . here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed especially , reducing the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of people
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison sentence , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , in@@ mates are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
&quot; in a decision published on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court has decided this . &quot;
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on the free foot after data of his lawyer , was moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his detention conditions due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the judges accepted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity injured .
the Chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days arrest days for compensation are decisive , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a reduction of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; in April , they talked to a prisoner of damage because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday that the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the former pla@@ inti@@ ff lived between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons were also in the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; deta@@ inees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ ckets it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice Press Office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young talent , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that .
what is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it was built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are taken out of the rental price , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view is much too little : 80 000 social apartments each year need to be created , and the federal government would have to invest a total of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and federal mini@@ stries are in agreement that there must also be more tax benefits for residential construction investments . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to help them get started , &quot; says Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the throne , there has been a political turning point : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; whereas previously there was a ban on labour for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence duty , the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the perspective has mostly prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; up to now , there is still no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed through personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the establishment of networks is the king &apos;s path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few neglected parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the deprived parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ as , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators rises sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more vocational schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the lessons of welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
student @-@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ e , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to death . &quot;
&quot; for four years , tolerated refugees had to live in Germany in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , this span will be shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016 . &quot;
&quot; but also this gap must be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ e .
&quot; in the future , Islam will play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to evolve into a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic well @-@ being association , who professionally takes care of newcom@@ ers . &quot;
obligations also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him some control options . &quot;
this also belongs to the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately gave their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be a topic of the whole society much more than today . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will have to change , breaking down discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a decade .
&quot; but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and require international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany , must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the good of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system for this . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all newcom@@ ers to hand over the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seekers act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors will primarily make the language barriers possible . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants become more informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpretation costs have to be taken over , it demands . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; in refugee children , for example , there are significantly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the don@@ or , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the welfare offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ez@@ h invites to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ ine and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current stage management .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift for fan@@ atics is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the barely 3,000 @-@ kilometre @-@ long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the circus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily record . &quot;
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
their hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with a sense of intuition and articul@@ ation . &quot;
balancing with the imp@@ eller on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake humans fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ anie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often a topic in various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good too . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying every stro@@ king unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sts &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , something is likely to be there . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether 5 or 1 200 people , we always do our best and with all your heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September , daily at 5 pm and 8 pm . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe mis@@ ses the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr .
&quot; in the past month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; she warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the restructuring and savings efforts of the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that close @-@ focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is progres@@ sing according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was only an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in contact with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a pleas@@ urable time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he ear@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger places a rotation inside the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal has clear favour@@ ites to move forward by Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal drew lessons from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven from the far @-@ off hope to lead the association with his management to his first European cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to this in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men at the age of 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you first have to have friends so that friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication guided by social media , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the Beau@@ tiful at Friends was that this focus was put on my head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football sta@@ ins in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; My role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are su@@ ici@@ dal is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest this weekend with the backdrop of a completely re@@ designed backdrop for the celebration of the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria arrives on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move past Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main held his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master along the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems and look back relaxed even though there are certain things we need to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on the weekend in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was designated as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went in to Marco Ver@@ lag@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense , before he finished Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , was competing with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic passing by Kevin Tra@@ pps poles in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G himself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who fell in the first half alone in no less than five attempts alone after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shot that was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the end result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a door at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the skill games are not enough . &quot;
hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core accumulated $ 2.5 billion through share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is located in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge school identification plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about CHF 1.6 billion , in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the tip of London &apos;s stock exchange while trading on Wednesday early Wednesday morning .
&quot; shares jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices fell by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was apparently shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion champion , twice champion champion , twice champion champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already in front of the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
it was told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered to FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann assumed the FC Bayern . &quot;
guard was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how the season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the whole distance on the lawn , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on brings down variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night at HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted horri@@ fied , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a groove , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction could give us something that we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against colour schemes . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , the leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ l invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos; American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional clim@@ ber and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the fin@@ als . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 dollars or had it to life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and change life , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll get any gru@@ dge .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last position in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two circles , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to close this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go completely focused into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designed Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the sleep @-@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he put it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ run the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run rip . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run in the second run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the major league in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit joined a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth indoor ring , Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pitches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two circles against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been stri@@ cken before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had missed more than a month because of his back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes handed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder block , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to fight against T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tiger , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th &quot;
he was missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden communicated on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an capital were prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other local authorities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse , according to the governing presi@@ dency of the government responsible for the first time . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states &quot; collective elimination . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Minister for Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
also Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mr Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with passing border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee status in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; in the late Tuesday evening , the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection are ashamed of them too . &quot;
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a pencil @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this opinion was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge force exer@@ tion . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be set up with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants have been on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean is s@@ apping .
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the moon stum@@ bles on its orbit around the ring @-@ planets . &quot;
&quot; although this stag@@ gering movement is only small , but still too big for a permanent body of the cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the leaf@@ let &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; the extent of the hidden ocean , however , was not cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 Munich for several weeks
&quot; around a month , the 1860 München has to do without Val@@ det R@@ ama &apos;s offensive player . &quot;
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich lions , the diagnosis &quot; probably means four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a united professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ ker Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is said to go into running training . &quot;
oc@@ top@@ ia was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h on his head .
&quot; contrary to his first fears , however , he remained without a serious sh@@ utter . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
&quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus supports ten@@ si@@ le strength , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly . &quot;
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes . &quot;
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; for the Christmas business in the United States , the US par@@ c@@ els service U@@ PS again represents up to 9@@ 5000 subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the company started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looking for .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce by 9@@ 5000 subsidies for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex meet earlier than last year to prepare for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services . &quot;
&quot; first fo@@ eh@@ ement , then marked cold front &quot;
&quot; the next night falls in the valleys of the Alp@@ illes side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and on the night of Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm strength through the fe@@ ather valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow . &quot;
&quot; on the mountain@@ side , the F@@ öhn stops in the night through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn blows until Thursday morning in the valleys with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i country partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n for summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ hang starts to st@@ ow away . &quot;
here is a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in sum , the south of the Alps has to be calculated in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , which has already fallen in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air dri@@ es out , as a result , a cold front rolls with powerful , partly weather@@ ed ra@@ ins from West to East over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind is blowing strong to stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es , for centuries as a minority , could often only live in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the place , in a symbolic way , I become visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian monks at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he received the city as a deca@@ yed sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions might have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
&quot; with his thes@@ es , Luther had initiated the split of the Western Church with his thes@@ es . &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works of Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with sum@@ p@@ tuous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who , in 150 motifs , formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles were created which dev@@ ote topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishers with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible school by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were the cause of the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened again with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to work to work with the Lord &apos;s father again .
his second aim is to bring art back to more importance in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the images &quot; , &quot; let them look , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; I have always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like him to live with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t pay attention to completely capture the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes that were important to him . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th . &quot;
construction start for BM@@ X railway is approaching
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth hills for a circular course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already over again . &quot;
&quot; failure in politics and administration caused a dr@@ astic decline , especially in residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so , hill @-@ down , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; in October , the First Joint Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to communicate with the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then start with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without a &quot; further pause . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the politicians its help in tackl@@ ing the pending problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I believe this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister for State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
soccer can and wants to help .
but the crucial turn@@ outs must put politics .
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal lists also support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they are wearing the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we football feder@@ alists can , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so much , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Play against Hungary this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed clubs had started their own projects in their places is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the Association together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; according to reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water glass , which he carried on his left hand after midnight , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost bled , was power@@ less , got out of the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the S@@ Z said , &quot; Every@@ thing can happen . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you have fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered injuries when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; therefore , during the night race in Singapore at the weekend , he is just as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two common pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ quired , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Do@@ or
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback made by Marco R@@ eus have defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ eus will be back again on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en , the B@@ V@@ B coach has left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he announced a change to the position of the door@@ keeper . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal chief Roman bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the World Champion praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player R@@ eus , that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl is understandable : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot Cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; new mobility era &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IA@@ A .
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which will also come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and spe@@ edy access to digital radio communications . &quot;
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; eliminate any additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government aims to &quot; review the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally to raise the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads should not be expected to reach far after 2020 . &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German location estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the issue of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it until 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the USA . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title battles , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf wants to open only in singles from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision is to be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys got to know it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; said Mr. Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term partnership agreement in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer a clear favorite , &quot; explained one of the European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the se@@ ed@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also missed , and we became European Champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; explained the fifth part of the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; during the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the Defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis indicated the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player of Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ gru@@ el for a sh@@ it leg break .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figures horror cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins which make it look fri@@ ghtful thanks to video projections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with the fact that he put men into skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the f@@ ant of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at first . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded like a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hardly surviving work of the man , who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was carried out : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged . &quot;
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich with 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example to cover ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en fashion company . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® , fashion played a major role , was then pushed aside by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , borrow@@ ed from past epo@@ chs , is an increasing customer potential . &quot;
anyone who does not use niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already carry out half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , fashion company P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
there are almost no private specialty stores and wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the United States . &quot;
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points with environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the firms that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to hold a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small spheres in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ er gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by his inspiration : &quot; before , I could not start with a traditional P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a lab@@ orious process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who want a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador to the P@@ lau@@ er tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not supposed to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to watch a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it &apos;s not about a new movie but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child maid . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws are still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already standing firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list to regulate the market access , the elimination of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents milking system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a legally @-@ state business environment and more open to the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen checks on the power transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also highlighted that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a statement released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish , and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that , on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ ably . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ard @-@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy , &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal which is po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is strongly enriched over the food chain mainly in predat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is therefore cau@@ tioned against the fact that &quot; &quot; small quantities can cause particularly in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on his homepage , the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily due to the burning of coal into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock generate more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
