&quot; this explains their comprehen@@ sion as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include approval or an underlying knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grows in carrying out their respective obligations from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , however extraordinary costs as a result of a special seeking of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se the costs , provided that it has been in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be applied to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
any claim that the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization for damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - is asser@@ ted in accordance with international law .
&quot; after veri@@ fying the relevant information submitted by the Director @-@ General , the Council shall verify that no core material that must be subject to securing measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear weapons , it may take the reports envis@@ aged in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the statute and if necessary also take the measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account what mass was obtained through the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is affected - any justi@@ fiable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or the state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes resulting from an appointment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a procedure taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal on request of a party which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and states name two arbitr@@ ators ; the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed elect a fifth that presi@@ ded over . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the states or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration claim , the community or organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these refer@@ ees . &quot;
the same procedure is to apply if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; this Convention shall be concluded for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; if the organization of the organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures regarding this state , for the purposes of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties on a change of the Convention . &quot;
&quot; all amendments require the approval of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all Member States of the organization from any change of this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention occurs on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that its procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to set the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of the part I concerning securing measures .
the aim of the preventive measures laid down in this agreement is the timely detection of the distributing significant quantities of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence of such a branch by the risk of early detection .
&quot; to enrich the target specified in article 28 , material book@@ keeping is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ati@@ m with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the inspec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material shown for each material balance zone is specified for a specified period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their inspec@@ tions , the organization after article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying its security measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following species and they , as far as necessary , anticipate how they are determined and useful in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for the determination of the amounts of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and receivers ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; ( F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the modifications of this stock , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ; &quot;
measures to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement are not limited to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) In the states , ur@@ anium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) is not yet established , shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , is the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or is this core material or other , in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle produced in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this agreement are concluded for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled or desirable , the organization and community should consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be concluded for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ profit @-@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the Organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to security measures following this agreement , provided that the total amount of material released in the States is not at any time more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kilogra@@ m of special p@@ alt@@ able material consisting of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ( II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment lying under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and beyond the nature ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of complementary agreements , which are necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in detail how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ation of the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention in force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to enable these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organization provides a summ@@ arized inventory of the total core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action plan laid down at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is ham@@ pered by general resources transfer problems .
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the E@@ EC and the Member States , that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied to the agreement within six months after entry into force , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the means of association to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has submitted a table that is evident in what manner they intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction discount &quot; , &quot; which will contribute to the member states in accordance with this agreement and is used ( in this capacity the organisation is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the discount account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest bonds of the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction , and to be deposited with the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment takes place in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at any other time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every Member State may make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates upon request .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker is entitled to dispro@@ portion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the school notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to compensate for the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; in granting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ qualification ; and
VII ) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction is financed by the financing of a clearly outlined and rapidly re@@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it is part of the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices for which the pre@@ am@@ ble stated in this agreement is to be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction must not be used instead of decent funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions that are generally applicable to the organization granted for the organization ; thus , in ten free years , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of this watch are directly to the organisation which it retains .
each special transaction is determined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker in which in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
&quot; the revenues from each special transaction can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are established or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and that according to what the car@@ et@@ aker has appointed at the time of loan granted , may be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; payments made by special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until complete awar@@ ding of all the special transaction loans , the administrator teaches the E@@ EC on the plans and programs approved by the directors through the directors in preparation and on the projects approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loans , the administrator direc@@ ts the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses incurred for this . &quot;
the administrator sends the E@@ EC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction accounts with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization on this account statement .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction , the administrator of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which have been paid to the account and the payments paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full output of the special transaction accounts , will lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes financed by special transaction fees and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organization may , if necessary , have not entered into force , so the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the regular approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement will be effective and entered into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the stated noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two scrip@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each word is binding . &quot;
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amendment of the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is en@@ acted - HA@@ T follows :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a common company named J@@ ET , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; as far as the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is still to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement shall enable every contracting party to take the greatest possible benefit by mer@@ ging their research efforts in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , to achieve the common goal of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or changed after verification by the organs mentioned in article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; every time the parties accept a new program , this will take place in the place of the programme listed in An@@ nex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of staff under the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual rights to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project as part of the aim of this agreement .
&quot; in view of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall include an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the time of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Tre@@ aties on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the present agreement to the Joint Venture of J@@ ET , whose statutes are accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become contractual partners of any contract , whose purpose is to be concluded within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies charged with the implementation of the association designated in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement shall be described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the Association Agreement , in particular , intends to set up a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , assumes that this agreement relates to all research and development activities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the affiliated organs and direc@@ ts its T * to the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world must be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG identifies one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are concerned . &quot;
&quot; the counselling groups , which provide the VG research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task with regard to all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who has to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories that are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme . &quot;
&quot; in particular , he ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide the Committee of Directors with appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the means , staff as well as the knowledge and skills , on which the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme come true , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a member of the core and energy research representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F discusses the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of the future programs and the determination of their overall circum@@ ference , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Direc@@ torate @-@ Committee , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have consult@@ ative character . &quot;
VG &apos;s opinion on the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme is fixed annually to an amount that is cont@@ ested by Eur@@ atom at the cost of Eur@@ atom &apos;s GDP in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution concerns the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland is over@@ subscri@@ bed to the Common Market J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Joint Enterprise . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides for funding the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the Commission shares the amount to cover expenses as part of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this Article are specified in An@@ nex III of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to ensure that Eur@@ atom of customs duties or other charges , as well as import restrictions and restrictions imposed by Eur@@ atom , will be exemp@@ t from the part of the items to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , the items acquired or purchased there must neither be sold nor paid for free in this country unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to rest @-@ sal@@ aries and suffer@@ ers who are paid to these people .
&quot; in article 14 and 15 of this agreement , the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange are regulated in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement . &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge which apply to the participation of Switzerland at the Common Market J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ utes of the Joint Enterprise .
the right of each contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and associated third countries in awar@@ ding orders to carry out the two associated programmes according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and associated organs in the areas of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , will justify the access to these knowledge under the same conditions as the Member States , Person@@ s or Companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;
the knowledge gained in the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the associated third states as well as the individuals or companies who operate research or production activities in a Member State of Eur@@ atom or associated third @-@ state research or production activities that justify access to these knowledge .
&quot; the parties shall share this knowledge with other states , persons or companies only if a signed agreement is made between the parties unless these individuals or companies operate research or production activities that justify access to these knowledge . &quot;
&quot; patents filed under section 1 and 2 of this article are protected by patents , so these patents can be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third @-@ states and the persons or companies resident in the countries concerned for research purposes in pursuing the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third @-@ states and the persons or companies resident in the countries concerned may be granted lic@@ ences or sub @-@ licenses for use of these patents for industrial or commercial purposes as far as the parties are authorised to grant such licenses or sub@@ licenses . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained from Eur@@ atom &apos;s activities , associated organs and Switzerland prior to the entry into force of this agreement will be made accessible to states , individuals or companies , to whom the knowledge specified in paragraph 1 and 2 is necessary , insofar as this is necessary for the use of the knowledge drawn in these dig@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patents , which deri@@ ve from the activities referred to in this paragraph , are provided to those states , individuals or companies that may obtain a license or sub @-@ license to the patents mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article , as far as this is necessary for the use of these licenses or sub @-@ licenses . &quot;
the rights to the invent@@ ors or their legal success@@ ors are not affected by this article .
the parties shall refrain from any action that could imp@@ air the in@@ ventions of in@@ ventions arising from the activities mentioned in paragra@@ phs 1 and 2 of this article .
&quot; a mixed committee with the term &quot; &quot; Fu@@ sion@@ ing Committee of Eur@@ atom / Switzerland &quot; &quot; will be used , the representative of the Commission and representatives of the Federal Council . &quot;
it checks all measures by which cooperation can be improved in the framework of the agreement and keeps on ongoing progress on the status of the work .
&quot; if a contracting party believes that the other contracting party has no obligation in the framework of this agreement , it is un@@ as@@ cri@@ bed to the Euro Committee of Eur@@ atom Switzerland . &quot;
the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland fusion committee can discuss the implementation of its tasks based on the opinion of the VG recommendations that will be communicated to the authorities of the Eur@@ atom countries and Switzerland responsible for the adoption of programmes and budget plans in the research areas .
the chair@@ manship is held alter@@ nat@@ ely by the parties in accordance with the Rules of Proced@@ ure of the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland merger committee .
the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland fusion committee meets at least once a year at the request of one of the contracting parties .
disputes relating to the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal upon request of one of the two parties .
the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal stated in paragraph 1 of this article shall be made in case of case .
&quot; each contracting party ap@@ points a member , and these two members determine a third member representing the chair@@ manship of the arbit@@ ration court . &quot;
each contracting party bears the costs of its own member in the arbit@@ ration proceeding ; the cost of the seat and the remaining costs are borne by the same parts of both parties .
it enters into force when the parties have communicated to each other that the procedure required for this procedure has been carried out .
this agreement will be closed for the duration of the Eur@@ atom programme mentioned in Article 1 ; it will be tac@@ itly extended in accordance with other relevant programme resolutions of Eur@@ atom .
&quot; if such a further program is issued , the extension for the duration of the new program will apply to the Eur@@ atom programme listed in An@@ nex I . this agreement is considered to be un@@ finished if there is only delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; before every decision on the acceptance of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the contracting parties are consul@@ ted in the articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement . &quot;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time with a deadline of six months .
in the form of a letter change to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
&quot; in addition , in order to simplify the procedure for adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes to the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further to include in the agreement an article 12 to record . &quot;
&quot; I invite you to confirm the agreement of the Community on these changes , and propose you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 . &quot;

I would be grateful if you confirmed the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobil@@ isation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial state
&quot; BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks put an appropriate application . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds from the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in every stand @-@ by credit the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions to be exceeded , but without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the credits as well as with any extension of the extension , the BI@@ S would charge a loan opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , probably in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those transactions carried out by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary resources on the market itself , then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks put an appropriate application . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
I honor to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set up provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . during these negotiations the two parties are over@@ tax@@ ed as follows : &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set at the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the agreed annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties should consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community claims protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;

&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are stipulated in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which will be taken into account under the number 5 of the value added under number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount named under number 2 is fixed on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community applies precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of intervention boards on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the shipments of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb not under@@ mined . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only to be taken into account with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a manner compatible with Articles XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export licenses specified under the number 1 specified in this agreement . &quot;

the details for the application of this system are defined in such a way that a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be dispens@@ ed with for question@@ able products .
&quot; in addition , in transit terms , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals indicates the quantities issued for export lic@@ ences ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted to the destination country if necessary . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and functioning smoothly .
&quot; it regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat @-@ meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions stated in number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be imp@@ acted by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will be carried out under the agreement not named after the Community . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;

&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is vital and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal paragraph of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not com@@ promised on these markets , I ad@@ ore to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will be ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand ob@@ tains assurance that the normal sales of his H@@ amm@@ el and lamb will not be affected by the application of the regulation .

the total amount stated in clause 2 will be determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community applies precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of intervention boards on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of this goal . &quot;

&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only to be taken into account with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities stated in clause 2 in particular that there are no export licenses beyond these quantities .
&quot; the community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , in order that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is subject to the origin in New Zealand by the submission of an export license , which is granted by the authority designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are defined in such a way that a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be dispens@@ ed with for question@@ able products .

&quot; in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria , Uruguay on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set up provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . during these negotiations , the two parties are covered as follows : &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( F@@ are 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff ; &quot;
&quot; - Fro@@ zen H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( F@@ are 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set according to the Community at the following annual amount : &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is required to ensure that the agreed annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties should consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community claims protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the community comm@@ its to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ st@@ et of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount set under number 2 according to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with every new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are stipulated in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which will be taken into account under the number 5 of the value added under number 5 . &quot;
the total amount stated under number 2 will be set to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community applies precau@@ tions in order that the sales of intervention boards on frozen meat are not under@@ mined because of the implementation of the regulation the paragraph of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ian labour . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only to be taken into account with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a manner compatible with Articles XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export licenses specified in this agreement for the products named under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community itself comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , in order that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is issued by the authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is also specified that the competent Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community is informed of the quantities at regular intervals for export lic@@ ences ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted to the destination country . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of the Republic of Uruguay on the other hand . &quot;

&quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood delivery is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle by a closed , sterile tube system into which the anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution was introduced before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after completion of the blood removal , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C. thereafter it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not exceed 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system must be determined beforehand by the blood cells and serum ; determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; in so far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , they are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific studies have yiel@@ ded the absence of anti@@ gens C , D , you and E . &quot;
the blood released after this agreement shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .

&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been extracted ; other blood cells may be present or may have been removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentr@@ ates consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , with the use of a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;

&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by drying the liquid , which is deposited at the top of the centri@@ fu@@ gi@@ val or sedi@@ mentation of human whol@@ em@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained through cold drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can be easily dissolved in a water quantity , which corresponds to the amount of liquid from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution obtained must not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution may not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) a dangerous content of in@@ soles or immune her@@ me@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine have been determined are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of blood removal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood donations which show signs of a bacterial infection are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cent @-@ hepatitis , it is necessary to take compounds that do not contain more than 12 donations , or use other methods that are known to reduce this risk in a similar manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out during the production of the plasma , must be added to the amount of water ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C. &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , the amount of liquid produced from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de is found , coag@@ ulation occurs ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ H drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of at most 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss of more than 0.5 % may not occur in the human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is in a nitrogen ath@@ mosph@@ ere or in an empty space in a sterile , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro@@ organisms and after possibility of any moisture to store ; it is protected from light and keep on a temperature below 20 C. &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and frac@@ tions from human plasma proteins are preparations of the protein component consisting of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the human body .
&quot; regardless of whether the final product should be flu@@ ffy or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C after adding a suitable stabili@@ zer in the final container for 10 hours in order to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of the I@@ no@@ cent hepatitis . &quot;
&quot; in preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the available proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
in both preparations no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin G may be present per gram of the product .
&quot; if the finished product is freeze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the group is made of human plasma proteins as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
comparative measurements of vis@@ cosity and tur@@ bi@@ dity as well as centri@@ fu@@ ges with Ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and Electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis that are carried out before and after heating on the solutions may not result in signs of den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins .
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ stage solids in a mechanical cont@@ actor at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;

&quot; in other preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in and in frac@@ tions made of human plasma proteins , the sodium concentration 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l per litre solution or recovered dry cap should not exceed . &quot;
the potassium concentrations of the frac@@ tions of human plasma proteins must not exceed 2 m@@ mo@@ l per litre of solution or re@@ manufactured dry preparation .
&quot; according to di@@ lution , the pH value of each preparation has to be a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution containing 0,@@ 15 mo@@ l potassium chlori@@ de per litre , at a measurement temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.2 . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ level drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of at most 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight losses of less than 0.5 % may not occur during the drying preparations . &quot;
&quot; human dry alb@@ um@@ in is in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an empty space in sterile , closed container under exclusion of micro@@ organisms and by possibility of moisture to store ; it is protected from light and keep on a temperature below 20 C. &quot;
&quot; solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and frac@@ tions from human plasma proteins must be stored in sterile , sealed containers , under exclusion of micro@@ organisms . they must be protected against light and keep at a temperature of 4 to 6 C. &quot;
the label on the container contains all data listed on the corresponding Mu@@ stere@@ otype ( system 4 ) .
&quot; normal human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is a preparation made of plasma protein , which is made from human , the antibodies of normal adult contained in the whole blood . &quot;
the method used must ensure that the final product yields the conditions described below and does not transfer I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ ary .
&quot; in addition , the production method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product are concentrated in sufficient quantities in the final product . &quot;
&quot; the method is satisfactory for each end preparation , when in the initial and final product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ tr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; during production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ i@@ ost@@ atic substance may be added to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and stability of the final product , a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabil@@ isation agent can be added to it . &quot;
the final product is delivered as a solution whose immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ in@@ concentration must be between 100 and 170 g per liter .
&quot; the electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , represented by exposed particles under acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the protein mass has the flexibility of the gran@@ ul@@ ins of the normal human plasma . &quot;
&quot; the final solution must neither be visible before nor after a 7@@ day heating to 37 C visible signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ d@@ iness . furthermore , it is advisable . &quot;
&quot; tests using the centri@@ fu@@ gal method in the centri@@ fu@@ gal centri@@ fu@@ ge , in order to determine in which mass the product falls in components with a lower molecular weight . &quot;
&quot; after di@@ lution , the pH value of the final solution must be to a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution containing 0,@@ 15 mo@@ l potassium chlori@@ de per litre , at a measurement temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0,@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the solution from human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is to be stored in sterile , closed container under exclusion of micro@@ organisms ; it must be protected from light and keep on a temperature of 4 to 6 C. &quot;
&quot; further specific human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins can be produced ; if an international standard exists , they are to be checked according to this standard , and their efficiency is to be specified in International Units . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated in a suitable medium .
ti@@ ghtness is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely of the volume of the blood cells in@@ undation in the total volume .
&quot; in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group identification International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series in which a microscop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification , for the International Standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren , according to the definition , contain 256 International units per ml . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ ent form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfying efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents is determined according to the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation attempts ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by means of further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to the anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ xes or re@@ char@@ ted serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in flu@@ ent form or after replacement , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents identified for international exchange for blood group identification should not be arti@@ ficially colored as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group identification are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the laboratory laboratory has written written records of all stages and controls of the re@@ agents for blood group identification .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued are kept from the laboratory so long , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group identification may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for ampli@@ fying the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective approach into three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

the convey@@ ances related to the goods transport between the parties shall be fu@@ elled by means of a single api@@ ary to use the pre @-@ print according to the samples in An@@ nex I to this agreement .
&quot; according to the case , the paper paper serves as registration or paper for export , shipping method or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out the legislation applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the uni@@ denti@@ fied regi@@ men ; &quot;
&quot; - demanded by the parties , so that they may be able to enter the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the parties to use simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further simpli@@ fications for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In particular , simplified procedures can be seen in particular that the relevant goods are not subject to a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete registration can be approved . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed with the consent of the relevant authorities for a periodi@@ c collection application to be submitted within the period specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be allowed to use instead of a single api@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; if the uni@@ denti@@ al paper is used , the parties involved with the consent of the relevant authorities may include the export and import@@ ation related recei@@ v@@ ables instead of the supplementary sheets on the retail paper in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to close agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the transfers for their entire goods , or for sections ; &quot;
&quot; - for consi@@ gn@@ ments , which include several types of goods to be used for the fulfillment of the recei@@ v@@ ables in the shipping method Lad@@ eli@@ sten , instead of the supplementary sheets for a paper paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow registr@@ ations to be created , if necessary , without pre @-@ pressure by public or private data processing plants according to the conditions set out by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant transfers to their data processing systems for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , if necessary , without giving a written registration ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system to treat the registration , or if such a paper is not created by entering data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
- to apply any facil@@ itation adopted by the Joint Committee on the way of a resolution pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 .

&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the destination country or the country of transit shall require a translation of the registration in the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
( 2 ) Regi@@ stration of paragraph 1 shall always be excluded in one of the official languages of the import @-@ country if they occur in this country under the use of others as the copies issued by the customs office of the export or departure country .
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use for each section of a commodity exchange between the contracting parties , which can only be used for the fulfillment of the form@@ alities only with this one section , which may be attached to the copies required for the fulfillment of the form@@ alities at one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collecting shipments , the competent authorities can , however , be able to see that the provisions for export and shipping methods are carried out on one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies envis@@ aged for these transfers . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies printed in the individual proceedings coinci@@ de with the registration . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The customs authorities of these countries face each other on request , or if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance can be denied or denied , if the requested country of view is that the administrative assistance would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or to viol@@ ate a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the event of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its justification for the seeking land shall be dispro@@ portion@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) In@@ dic@@ ates the customs authority of a country for administrative assistance , which could not afford it , if it is requested , it points out in its search for that circum@@ stance . &quot;
( 5 ) The information obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this agreement and enjoy the protection given to the country &apos;s internal right of the country that it has received .
&quot; these information may only be used otherwise with the written consent of the customs authority which they have issued , and subject to restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
