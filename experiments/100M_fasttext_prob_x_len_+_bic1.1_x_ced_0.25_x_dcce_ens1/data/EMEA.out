this document is a summary of the European Public Monitoring Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ elessly thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a psych@@ ic illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tray in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , has a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was examined in three studies up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours compared to a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturbances ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s advantages in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who were predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which man@@ ic episodes approached the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to the risks .
&quot; moreover , the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution during rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance when oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; if patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy showed signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicating a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in conditions associated with conv@@ ul@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk risk compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regards to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the common application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dosage height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns arising in reproductive studies in animal reproduction , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ema , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes occurred in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing is beneficial , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated using a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor , as well as an excessive aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the cau@@ cus cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a semi @-@ operation @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents responded to a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ Depres@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return dropped at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially spoke about 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ bing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle elimin@@ ation@@ ary period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabol@@ isi@@ zers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a specific analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate any clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the ethnic affili@@ ation or impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not allow any particular danger to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that exceed the maximum dosage or exposure in humans so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
&quot; in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ y@@ c@@ ine @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ y@@ c@@ ine @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l not contain more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated using a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated using a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 34 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated using a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed up against the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the melt tablets alternatively to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders were reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS include high fever , muscular rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dio , swe@@ ating , and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated using a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic was compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 In addition a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution is used for rapid monitoring of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle in circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melt tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS include high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dio , swe@@ ating , and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regards to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared with the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly used and the simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dosage height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes occurred in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al problems was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ dep@@ t and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Inj@@ ection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms with respect to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of the bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient number . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a semi @-@ operation @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents responded to a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia ( oral ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return dropped at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg compared with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially spoke about 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposition was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in two studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application for systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which were 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns emerged after mat@@ ernal exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not allow any particular danger to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in regards to efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing the disease and survival , there was no difference between the medicines . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited as a permit to transport Abra@@ x@@ ane to the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not displayed ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient group are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual methods of anti@@ em@@ ulation and con@@ sti@@ pation . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to one month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child . &quot;
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm count because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 reported the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart diseases : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burn , dry mouth , pain@@ less g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , or@@ ale pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the thor@@ ax wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pains in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ es@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the combination of micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ poly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital Inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the Trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it was proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ escence receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the tumor area due to the alb@@ umin@@ escent protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
&quot; the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed , un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study study . &quot;
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma . &quot;
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy of pac@@ lit@@ axel for 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue bonding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and also the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the average value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and against light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile spra@@ yer slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ flow bottle .
&quot; after complete en@@ core the solution should rest at least 5 minutes , in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solids . &quot;
&quot; then the water bottle should be swi@@ vel@@ ed and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itation or galvan@@ ic substances are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must be in@@ correctly inver@@ ted to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before application . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast carcin@@ oma when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane may not be applied : • If you are hyper@@ sensitive to pac@@ lit@@ axel or any of the other components of Abra@@ x@@ ane • If you are breast@@ feeding • If your white blood cells are hum@@ idi@@ fied ( initial values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about it )
&quot; special caution when applying Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have a impaired kidney function , if you suffer num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness , if you suffer from severe liver problems • if you have heart problems &quot;
&quot; please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs , as they may cause an interaction with abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to one month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; in addition , they should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm count , because the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment is the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; the use of machinery Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; if you are also receiving other medicines within the scope of your treatment , you should consult with regards to driving or serving of machines from your doctor . &quot;

&quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in the water bottle up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) when it is stored in the box to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; • After the re@@ constitution , each ml of the suspension contains 5 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ escence from humans ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and use of Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
then slowly and carefully pi@@ v@@ ise and / or in@@ vert the water bottle until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done .
&quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and inj@@ ected the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane into an empty , sterile PVC @-@ in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot;
par@@ enter@@ al medicines should be subjected to any particle and disc@@ olo@@ ur@@ ation before applying a visual inspection .
stability of un@@ opened bottles with abra@@ x@@ ane are stable up to the date specified on the packaging when the pier@@ cing bottle is stored in the box to protect the contents from light .
&quot; after the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should be filled immediately into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the owner of authorisation for placing on the market will provide healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also known as &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected prior to the procedure . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is required and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was treated as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients , suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks before they were inj@@ ected either to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled Ab@@ se@@ amed were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as in patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed compliance with the European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the in@@ convenience of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient in the case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood for men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
&quot; H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia and consequ@@ ential symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is necessary by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in patients with or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 3.6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical findings suggest that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is necessary by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for the control of an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recycled mass of ≥ 40,000 cells / kg , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes number &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) respectively the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te quantity by &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the treatment should be abor@@ ted on epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible , e.g. several weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was supposed to pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; patients who are diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an Ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ut@@ esc@@ ales or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ; severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently entered cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden effect loss , defined as reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency ) should be investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; index &quot; ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if there is no other reason of a loss of action , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be identified and an examination of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA should be considered . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous applications of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stimul@@ ant agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributable to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration above the concentration required for the control of an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should include a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should have an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can occur in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy had been returned if a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor threads , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis . &quot;
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ col and is identical with the endo@@ genous humane ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ aerobic patients . &quot;
it could be shown by means of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumours and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were investigated in five large controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to various more frequent malign@@ ant melan@@ omas than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and at inspec@@ tions .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with nearly the 20@@ x of the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ low body weight , to a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in red@@ dish mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of up to 3 days outside the cooling case and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so if necessary , dimensions of partial quantities are possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .

&quot; prior to the market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of approval for transport has to provide the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • A summary of the features of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . &quot;
the owner of the authorization for the placing of the drug has to make sure that the pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is established and functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as it is used in the transport .
&quot; the holder of approval for the in@@ tranet is obliged to carry out studies and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , as stated in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as any subsequent update of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures , • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) &quot;

&quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is re@@ formed during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , loss of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the beginning of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rarely has been reported about the appearance of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ an@@ em ( spra@@ yed under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age marks due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for the evaluation of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ anic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you have already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances the tumour can neg@@ atively affect the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , before treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will then arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how you inj@@ ections yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular membranes ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special Bew@@ are when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; after repeated blood donations , it can - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - may result in blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) . &quot;

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , such as the bone growth , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies to 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) normal@@ ised or decreased at least 75 % compared to the output value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion area and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; April 2005 , the European Commission issued an approval for the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited as a permit to transport A@@ cla@@ sta to the entire European Union . &quot;

intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , as bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and teenagers A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data for safety and effectiveness are missing .
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be weigh@@ ed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
the frequency of cases reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dysfunction of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases referred to as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after receiving was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the disease @-@ pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions following the administration of zinc cit@@ ric acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw @-@ area was performed , especially in the case of cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports are related to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis in the jaw area at a patient with A@@ cla@@ sta and patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Sc@@ ore for the ch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on the morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta demonstrated a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased the bone density at lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ lic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the scar@@ f of 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pool spon@@ ge were taken . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cla@@ sta significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at all time points and scar@@ ves at all times .
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % of the total population and 4.3 % at the scar@@ city . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) was the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta in comparison to the once weekly gift from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at referring to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta has been studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the average age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of zinc cit@@ ric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 patients with A@@ cla@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ a 0.@@ 24 and t ½ @-@ 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimin@@ ation@@ ary period t ½ g 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced clear@@ ance of metabol@@ ised substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dys@@ functions down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ tu@@ ally active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
&quot; in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic effects occurred in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is known , which could affect the current safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • within 60 days , if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is dis@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by restoring the bone structure again to normal , thereby securing a normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you take other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are using drugs that are known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta in combination with food and drink , worry that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you can take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can act longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you missed the appointment of A@@ cla@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta Falls , consider your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion appear very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) but less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this user information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to make the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic circul@@ ating , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is additionally applied to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond that or more
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA , the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tissue . n@@ g The complete list of side effects reported in connection with A@@ COMP@@ LIA is the packaging supplement . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause suicide thanks to a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is provided with concur@@ rent application of A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ or@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ COMP@@ LIA &apos;s effectiveness in weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight

A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data for efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported for up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who , in addition to obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons may point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; in a second study in patients with an obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute variation of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo . &quot;
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z
&quot; for 2 hours , the Ste@@ ady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ t@@ rough = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; the influence of food : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in a so@@ bri@@ ety state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , had a 67 % increased C@@ max or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C . &quot;
patients with black skin colour may have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and one by 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has 21 % higher C@@ max and one by 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ par@@ ative clinical data for safety and consequ@@ ential adverse effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic field were evaluated as possibly relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Monitoring Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sulph@@ onic hydrogen or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ n@@ ant , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional application of acet@@ ate to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ onic resin in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while adding placebo to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high concentration levels - in blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that acet@@ one should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metastatic disease in patients with which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence for Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. premature heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular cular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal area ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver cell values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the laboratory parameters are preced@@ ed by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected that can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin receive the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the reduction in hyper@@ insulin @-@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( present data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary alter@@ ation of the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as they are observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic active substances .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeded the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range as often as placebo , but less often than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ n@@ ant . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mac@@ ular disease the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency was rarely reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; there was a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ en@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the period until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three @-@ month improvement phase with insulin , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials for one year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was assessed in a small study of type 2 diabetes in a small dose of 18 weeks .
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced total plas@@ mat@@ o@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while in met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ en@@ cide reduced values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the wet tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly absorbed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies it could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to the oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the fung@@ us ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the middle plasma elimin@@ ation@@ ary period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and that of the entire active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects .
&quot; toxic studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increases the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced . &quot;
in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each of the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide have been investigated . &quot;
in clinical trials over 1 year a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the wet tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both about an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study showed the goal of their primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ al , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , stroke , acute coron@@ ary arter@@ ies , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , stroke , acute coron@@ ary arter@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who received comparative medication , showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the wet tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both about an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level indicating that blood sugar levels were similar to other human insulin levels .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane have to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be taken from the package ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; when travelling through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account any possible interactions with the therapy and consult his patients with other medicines taken from them .
&quot; 4 If hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes care , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system - Peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually rever@@ sible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar level can however be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Gel@@ tru@@ sively - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An der Inj@@ ection Authority can create a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if missed to change the insertion points within the injection unit .
&quot; during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma may occur at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; immune system disorders - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , per@@ spir@@ ation , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape picking , cand@@ y , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help person or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin @-@ products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insul@@ ine molecule have been considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not over 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instruction manual for the first use .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the inclusion of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the fast acting insulin must be absorbed , then the amount of the long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; the dose can be corrected both upward and down , by turning the dose selection button in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is opposite the dose indication . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who are already showing signs of de@@ hydr@@ ation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger deposits of urine that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism occur@@ ren@@ ces can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking other medicines for the prevention of sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily had a daily dose of 120 mg , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea , nausea , nausea , and abnormal liver values ) . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with cardiac complaints in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one of the medical history known or currently available , and / or arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum endurance level is still more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure is not recommended treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essed drugs , it can occur during the treatment start to an acute tox@@ in case , because the reduction of the serum sample level can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so wide that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the treatment and in the course of clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was no interaction studies carried out at F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( an inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; subjects were associated with simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg twice a day with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of un@@ desirable events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at onto the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a stimulus , magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects which could be associated with the medicine in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term and long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups in total more than once , and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term pro@@ long@@ ation studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , p@@ itu@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , eye dis@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency , rash , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , in@@ suffici@@ ency , in@@ suffici@@ ency in the blood , decrease of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te figure , decrease of the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism and is produced as part of the reac@@ tion@@ sk@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → Harn@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three month were designated serum levels of serum &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
&quot; lowering the serum sample level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 , sustained throughout the entire treatment . &quot;
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. h .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the serum concentration concentrations in subjects regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum res@@ ection levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) required a decrease in incidence of rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a poison feed ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the seed node size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the top marks by month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration of serum concentration , if it was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at plasma protein binding is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are primarily produced by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
&quot; the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7,5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed group , about the 11 @-@ fold of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were about 4.3 @-@ times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied the reduction of the performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are about 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the Company introduced data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with a low vitamin D mirror was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who received alone al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , con@@ sti@@ pation , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( cereb@@ ral stomach ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic cr@@ ushing . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union by Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or drop the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract besides p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , only be given special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; atro@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to treat symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or a new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 . the risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate a es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , some of them were rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens contains mainly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available which indicate whether the lowering of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet next morning after having noticed their om@@ issions .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but will continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
patients should therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials in common with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports originate from cancer patients but also for o@@ steopor@@ osis patients .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D asc@@ ents of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ters continued to uph@@ old ; the BM@@ D of Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability increased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour prior to a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy subjects the ability of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , al@@ en@@ dr@@ one is temporarily spread in tissue tissues , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fung@@ us . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ances did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the fung@@ us after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted quickly over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is present , it can be assumed that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced ren@@ al function a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ ph is administered adult patients to whom a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , with the application of Adv@@ agra@@ ph with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , to investigate how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplantation and investigated how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headache , nausea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the same at the same time must be adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ated yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; the formulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ ph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below )
&quot; after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was similar to the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks following transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the adv@@ agra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t prevention of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t prevention of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - switch from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph must be converted to a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dosage of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
&quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin with the oral initial dose for the prevention of transplan@@ t rejection . &quot;
&quot; heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day . &quot;
other transplan@@ t recipients although there is no clinical experience with advanced pancre@@ atic and transplan@@ t transplan@@ t patients in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case of pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow in the targeted area may be necessary for patients with severe liver dysfunction to reduce the dose .
&quot; since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine of the cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the general blu@@ t in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low @-@ level checks .
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , Chan@@ ges of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that might alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments may require several days until Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the indications in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level in the blood cannot exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually occur in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case of adren@@ al and cardiac transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; the formulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recep@@ tions in childhood does not yet have clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to lowering the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s blood and the weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , it was observed as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy referred to as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; as adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ated , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or decrease the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies revealed that the increase in blood levels resulted primarily from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the clear@@ ances of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly careful to take precau@@ tions about contrac@@ eption measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us could potentially reduce the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often not be determined exactly because of the disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often increased in patients suffering from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us cannot di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; effective mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular core . &quot;
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent hem@@ ming of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed evacu@@ ations confirmed within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % , and in the Progra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ ph and 9@@ 0.8 % for Progra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph Arm , 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) died . &quot;
&quot; kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Progra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t receivers . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ ph and 9@@ 7.5 % for Progra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph Arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the program arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) died . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Progra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody induction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t receivers . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy detection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ ph C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % Con@@ fi@@ dence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Progra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice daily applied Progra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Progra@@ f has developed into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplantation . &quot;
&quot; 175 treatment transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and employed in 6@@ 30 cases following intestinal transplantation as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral programmer in these published studies was consistent with the major studies in which Progra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; in an interim analysis of a recent multi @-@ centric study with oral Progra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rates after one year amounted to 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us came in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the development of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in one study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis is significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
a multi@@ center study with oral programmer has been carried out to 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t based on a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached to reach the desired level of tal@@ low from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; color@@ ect@@ al transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Progra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , which lead to desc@@ ents between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
factors such as low hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after transplantation .
&quot; this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly through bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f .
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;

adv@@ ant is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( due to the lack of factor VI@@ II conditional or con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether adv@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable the formation of the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; adv@@ ant is similar to another drug approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the drug contains no proteins of human and animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new sep@@ tic episodes was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ant ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to transfer lawyers to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the Factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period is not to drop below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute injury are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kilogra@@ m of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be directed at the patient &apos;s condition , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; developing the risk of inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereas the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ esi@@ tic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ R@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which showed higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the clear@@ ances rate again showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , no of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were often reported about the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other IV products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ actor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of Factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has approved its application for authorisation for the use of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , bones or soft tissue ( tissues that bin@@ ds other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is made from non @-@ defective in the human body , usually contributes to restoring damaged DNA and killing cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the sub@@ structure , in bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently proved that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently proven that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; com@@ bs @-@ use &quot; programmes with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients immediately and the other is released slowly over a couple of hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents 12 years older , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , oral drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for treating allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from con@@ ges@@ tive glaucoma ( hypertension ) , heart disease or vascular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by SP Europe to transport Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking them , to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ acet@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ group and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment in case of a hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations were observed from des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , however , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies yiel@@ ded no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , terri@@ fic mi@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral drying , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - dil@@ at@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 13 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily does not notice an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aqu@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet for healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not allow any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to develop its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0,5 mg / ml solution for insertion . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to show that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inclusion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptoms of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous illness and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed during their re@@ occurring .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the suspension of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 13 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ e- study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily . &quot;
&quot; as hist@@ amine replacement is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and from Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not allow any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ gly@@ col , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hypo@@ cris@@ y , mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years of infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to treat infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , experiencing higher substance loads ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study for adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; children between 1 and 11 years old , who were asked for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not notice an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not interfer@@ ing with psych@@ omot@@ or in clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol came neither to increase alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall core of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively allevi@@ ate the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ an ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted to metabolism .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several single dose studies NSC 631570 and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ ate can be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was tolerated well ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily does not notice an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily lay in the mouth , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tray must be removed without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tray proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate for intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied at pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dosage studies in children however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ max from A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for intake while food T@@ max from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n extends from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical ir@@ ation tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg has been used as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; at a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate for intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical ir@@ ation tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as with the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months the most common side @-@ effects reported more frequently than placebo was diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution was observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see under section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not notice an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ an ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
in several single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially approved by the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) to prevent A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s authorisation to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a trunk of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread by humans to humans because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a body foreign ) , has been puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination is not studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked , which anti@@ viral drug of the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay damage to the immune system and hence the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the high @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , formerly used as prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , compared to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only a few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers responded very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , previously treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , the drug A@@ gen@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , A@@ gen@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a greater amount of viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs , which are degra@@ ded as well as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years have out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited to permit A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for insertion is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of de@@ can@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should take place in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width , and may also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
plant preparations containing cur@@ rants ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under one age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced in duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ as@@ ci@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases associated with the treatment of medication which could be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B . higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , are reported about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ or@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ating anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase must not simultaneously be given with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low Therapeu@@ tic Wid@@ th A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose agents are metabol@@ ised predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to compensate for the low plasma levels caused by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects were observed on the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient already adop@@ ts St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; increased to 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day were applied twice a day that demonstrate the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % reduced when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ c component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in might reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; should these drugs be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ a@@ virus may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with an@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 % ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may cause interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase as it may cause res@@ or@@ ption disturbances . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , field@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % period interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect pronounced increases in plasma levels at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended to stabili@@ ze the mirror as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while offering am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 fa@@ xes .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation of how the pren@@ a@@ virus dosage is to be adapted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; at the same time receiving war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fying the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in milk lac@@ tate rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight was observed in the post @-@ seed period during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most adverse events associated with A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are associated with taking A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers did not receive pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and potential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin erup@@ tions were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular pap@@ ules , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice a day together with low doses ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures are initiated . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral genetic and ga@@ g pol@@ - poly@@ propylene steps with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r tann@@ ed treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 insul@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers not previously treated patients showed resistance samples , similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , I@@ 47@@ V , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers mut@@ ations : &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 54@@ A / C / S / S / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , as well as a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates .
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ lam@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a long @-@ term therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , with PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ submission of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ submission threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
there was no low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 B@@ ased on this data should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the medium duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ max , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing interval depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ ve C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice a day . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ functional disorder should be low to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after two daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , occurred in male animals . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not been solved yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications , showed little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al abl@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity . &quot;
&quot; so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of as@@ ce@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed high mortality both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be done in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug related factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increased to 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers would lower .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % period interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same time receiving war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fying the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ eth@@ in@@ ergi@@ c plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reduction in body weight was observed during the lac@@ tation period during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures are initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , therapy optimisation should be taken into account with PI pre @-@ treated children of the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing interval depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ ve C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ functional disorder should be low to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans were dis@@ continued after two daily doses of 1,@@ 200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not been solved yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications , showed little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al abl@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 showed high mortality both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ ile , the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for inclusion has neither been used with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for insertion is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules when they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to avoid this combination with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reli@@ eved for duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug and 49 dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , are reported about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ or@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increased to 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s significantly higher plasma concentrations are expected from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in milk lac@@ tate rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight was observed during the lac@@ ri@@ age . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are associated with taking A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r tann@@ ed treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early departure of a sa@@ w@@ aging 60 treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the subsequent treatment detri@@ mental .
62 B@@ ased on this data should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

&quot; • The application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is repeated five times weekly . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ ed thin to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated six weeks or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , the total healing rate of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a total healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is continued until all visible inc@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ine@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection occurs in the treatment area .
&quot; if in follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was left out , the patient should wear the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed , with ti@@ lt infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or Gra@@ ft versus Host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with one for circumcision leading strokes . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cr@@ ème immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatments applied to the treatment of external war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al area no clinical experience is present .
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of inc@@ lines in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has shown less effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line has not been studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days can be done . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate therapy forms should be taken into consideration in super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs have no clinical experience , therefore the application of previously untreated tumours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fo@@ etal development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after multiple topical application of quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation for use can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently shared and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of inc@@ isions ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most common reported and as likely or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include discomfort on the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine were shown below in a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related adverse effects , were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream are listed below .
&quot; according to the test plan , the clinical evidence indicated in these placebo showed that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , it frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 30 % ) , exc@@ itation / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the clinical evidence indicated in these studies shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and to severe she@@ ar formation and en@@ vo@@ icing ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental one @-@ time recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , might lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous de@@ hydr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the inc@@ isions in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; in 60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , patients healed completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be reached at 23 % from 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study showed that 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of weekly treatment in one or two weeks of treatment of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications extern@@ ally f@@ eig@@ ni@@ zes , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest dosage concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ we@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects for the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream , formerly and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice adverse events that are not listed in this user information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; in the study mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect in the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , check and update this summary . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms to observe the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to transfer Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me into the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in individual steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which rehabilitation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously followed . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the beginning of the in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ro@@ sis ) to minimize potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 are used ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the preceding reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk is recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 trial and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over with a treatment duration of up to 4 years are common in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s desired drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years , with predominantly severe form and treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a serum version , with patients aged 5 years old ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , no investig@@ able antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom there was never a serum version . &quot;
&quot; patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that didn &apos;t seem to harm the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely over male @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and capacity in the following table compared to the placebo group . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first four weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes spann@@ ing five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walking test , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , there was no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy run @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ Sc@@ ore for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe delay , only limited or no progress could be observed in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the holder of approval for the in@@ tranet has completed the following study program , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk relationship . &quot;
this register will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information about patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; patients suffering from M@@ PS I are an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in a small quantity or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are using drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet been diagnosed with chemotherapy ( cancer ) , or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body , or spread easily to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ method &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed or reduced or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ ic othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta treated longer survival times than with the comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each water bottle has to be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml of 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is extracted and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid on the day before and on the day after treatment .
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a minimum of 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a full blood image should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapeutic cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of dose a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row suppression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neutral @-@ count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in level 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ cot@@ ic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was performed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) for at least 2 days before the therapy .
&quot; all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients where these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be weigh@@ ed in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated living substances ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible fo@@ aming of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy .
&quot; since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life time such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when deciding to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ odi@@ zed an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in an application in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary - and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the locking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population since P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and well @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified for the recording of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were included :
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving ran@@ - dom@@ ed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included : &quot;
&quot; severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent , occasionally reported . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
clinical trials reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in case of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ OR@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural corneal end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant benefit compared to patients with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving trial medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural corneal end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ placed tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a delay of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy showed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring extends from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the products .
&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fatty diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats which have been added to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
&quot; in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stools , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( barrels ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or in breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ aller@@ genic , fatty diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ted , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Pre@@ vious treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adapted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs should be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ation prevention measures in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally standardised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained in the normal range of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a one @-@ time dose of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects identified after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported from a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to compounds with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings occurred .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects can be traced back to the li@@ pas@@ sive properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect takes place in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ aller@@ genic , fatty diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the starting value ( at the time of the random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the weight of the body in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 10 % of their output ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at ( output value of 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( starting point 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting point 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting point 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral dispens@@ ing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ si@@ fied Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) could be identified , which represented nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data can no longer be identified . &quot;

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 and older with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or over . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height or are overweight .
&quot; even if these diseases do not initially cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for inspection . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight that you lose as part of a diet , you can lose an additional kilogra@@ m with the help of all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood @-@ dil@@ uting effect . &quot;
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of or@@ ally @-@ increasing means of contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or removed if you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one for treating heart rhythms .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take al@@ i and • if you take medicines for high blood pressure as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
&quot; for more information on the blue pages in Section 6 , see how to define your cal@@ ori@@ ality and fet@@ al limits . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in combination with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body &apos;s new eating habits , start before the first capsule pick@@ up with a cal@@ orie and fatty diet . &quot;
&quot; nutritional di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely fall easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Nutri@@ tional dietary supplements to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity .
&quot; • all@@ i may not be taken longer than 6 months . if you do not have any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; • In case of successful weight loss , it is not necessary to change the diet at short notice and then return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since last meal , take the capsule after taking the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;

overweight has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Please talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ le , which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; which amount is suitable for you , please refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the function of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is decisive . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; • &quot; &quot; physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn up to 150 k@@ cal per day , working in the garden or doing other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily , for example through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gar@@ dening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For long @-@ lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and keep it . • It is a dietary journal containing information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat du@@ cks and give guidelines to becoming physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ sep@@ tic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies to 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 18@@ 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; compared to Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron may pro@@ long the colon cancer , patients with am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is offered with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five chemotherapy @-@ based chemotherapy ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions occurred between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ine and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ e@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ mac@@ ine ,
&quot; experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects to observe .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally measured in the total dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the overall texture ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , was comparable ; however , the C@@ max was higher after one @-@ time transmission of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effects on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , are involved in the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination Accor@@ ding to an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous captive bolt injection , the total body @-@ type was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , termin@@ ale elimin@@ ation@@ ary time and average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which suggests a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose corresponds to about the 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low as for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for the transport must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the drug approved as part of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the prescription of the drug intended to treat the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A which is already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a microscop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue has damages , and the results of the Alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) enzyme in the blood are increased . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study was measured , how many patients after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eus , the disease continued to respond to more patients than in the case of the reference drug , Al@@ ph@@ eus had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not affect this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface to be treated . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and inhibit@@ ors the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin cells , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( frozen cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA , or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the place of the job .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go weigh over the risks in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. to permit the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be taken into account ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection started . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of secondary infected wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in humans after topical application on scrat@@ ched skin or superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous oral application of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on a s@@ lic@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can dose adjustments are not required if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the impact of birth and fo@@ etal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used only if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding adjustment interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infection forms , should seek advice by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual systemic intake was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which resulted in an up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) s@@ lic@@ ed skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study at rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the two doses of two doses can be brought to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix contains the same components as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vaccine , which has been approved since 1997 , has been approved in 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing from three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the vaccine efficacy was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ iness and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances or any other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals from the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ori@@ tization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured if immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a hepatitis B vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , adequate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in cases of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody , so that further vacc@@ ination doses may be required in these cases . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal result , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or coag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception as it can come to bleeding in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate inj@@ ections at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tin , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there may be no sufficient immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the previous thi@@ omer salt and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation . &quot;
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the ambient of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given the Ambi@@ rix had a pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination @-@ vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum levels for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serum levels for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study , which was conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immunity was evaluated , the serum levels of serum ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after receiving the 3 @-@ dose substance . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those diagnosed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
a clinical study at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with a combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tin , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum conver@@ sions as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to investigate any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as by bathing in water contaminated by water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may need a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both V@@ acc@@ li@@ osis Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child is still not feeling ill or ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that may damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to that of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be conveyed . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching rash , breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection against end of the vaccine series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected for persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . if you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child undergo / undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or nursing women , unless it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • Appeti@@ zer deficiency
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( more than 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; further side effects , which have been reported for days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 displaced doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include spati@@ ally limited or extensive envel@@ opes that can be it@@ chy or b@@ lower , swelling of the eyes and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain cra@@ mps , di@@ zz@@ iness , dis@@ sen@@ sion such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant @-@ run &quot; , multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , severe headache and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

&quot; 23 In@@ form your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly adver@@ sely affect or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package . &quot;
ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has been known since issu@@ ance of the first authorization for the in@@ tranet , the CH@@ MP noted that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ ishes - split by several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esis ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was no comparative study , since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do drug , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia may also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle would effectively prevent ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ atte was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease , only limited information about this medicine occurred at the time of approval . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy occurs in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ sy@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately go into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys is performed , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a hin@@ dran@@ ce to brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted with humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these un@@ desirable events it was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the prog@@ nosis of early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life to death . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen separation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post @-@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time in many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment and in some patients there may be further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients suffering from ure@@ a @-@ cycl@@ ine disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was detected no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours , approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; following the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no compla@@ ined effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esis or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain bark . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; on the basis of investigations on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment and in some patients there may be further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected . &quot;
&quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products which accumulate after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if your laboratory studies are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , im@@ balances of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory disturbances and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room in order to initiate a corresponding treatment . &quot;
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
&quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , loss of skin , skin rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects not indicated in this user information .
&quot; after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can no longer be used after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the cargo box and the container . &quot;
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack@@ et AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;

&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on equal single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .

&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ ox in case of any gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the inclusion of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ release inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency access or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a reduction of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney dys@@ functions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second half dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second wrist dose to check again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after receiving the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular hay par@@ in .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to active hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if most of the arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during treatment in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and being treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again achieved prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregates ) , these active ingredients can increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than with male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for heavy bleeding such as in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point compartment , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than with male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use , and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organic classes . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately removed and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was unable to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ ine @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ induc@@ tive Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose Syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ questioning He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or to the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients were undergoing angi@@ ography in 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple points of a random@@ ised double blind study with over 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 . &quot;
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide goes through a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; the primary met@@ abo@@ lit , resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in animals during repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 cases of clinical Ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .

&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who need insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or to process insulin not effectively .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged four to 17 years . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to work effectively .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was found in insulin lis@@ per after six months . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
A@@ pi@@ dra cans have to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the in@@ version of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal muscles . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can result in a change in insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or break@@ age of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the change of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change with the conversion of the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that can increase blood sugar levels and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be weakened or absent from the effects of symp@@ athetic agents such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine enters into human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ted after oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed from clinical studies known as adverse drug reactions , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes and arranged according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , loss of vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to change the injection point within the injection unit , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by an appropriately trained person or administered by a doctor with intraven@@ ous administration of glucose .
&quot; after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed proportional glu@@ cos@@ es@@ thetic effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ately increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was evident that an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal reaches a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was trained in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a dose of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal , compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at least 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
