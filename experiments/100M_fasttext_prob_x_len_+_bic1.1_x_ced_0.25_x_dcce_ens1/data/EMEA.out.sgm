<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirelessly thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a psychic illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tray in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "neurotransmitter", "i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works as a "partial agony" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol, like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, has a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, preventing the recurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours compared to a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (drowsiness), tremor (drowsiness), nausea, drowsiness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Abilify's advantages in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who were predominantly manic episodes and in which manic episodes approached the treatment with Aripiprazol compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"moreover, the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution during rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disturbance when oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in case of treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerized and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with Abilify showed signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicating a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnese or in conditions associated with convulsions."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk risk compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events involving Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regards to worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be performed."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dosage height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate rise in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns arising in reproductive studies in animal reproduction, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathema, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients was placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes occurred in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK increases (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional overdoses with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing is beneficial, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated using a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor, as well as an excessive affinity for dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT2a, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in dosage of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the caucus caudatus and on the putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a semi-operation-controlled study, 52% of respondents responded to a response to study medication in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Depressions scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than for haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return dropped at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg in an average weight of ca.)."</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder Aripiprazol showed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study, over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially spoke about 2 weeks not on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazol was superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for stretching and hydroxybing of Aripiprazol, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle eliminationary period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolisizers over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= poor ') metabolites above CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific analysis for pharmacokinetics did not indicate any clinically significant differences with regard to the ethnic affiliation or impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not allow any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or exposures that exceed the maximum dosage or exposure in humans so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">"in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenycine-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenycine-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans)."</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of the Sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol not contain more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro-solubility."</seg>

<seg id="2035">"the evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, with PI, mainly with low-dose Ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"one hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"the primary analysis revealed the non-submission of APV / Ritonavir in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-submission threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml."</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbundled asterase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"in the studies, Agenerase was tested twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dose Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"after 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value."</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI pre-treated children of the expected benefits of "unbundled asterase."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"after oral administration, the medium duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"for Cmax, 508% is increased by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) is administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice a day)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"the administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12)."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of resorption."</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"while the absolute concentration of unconnected amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during dosing interval depending on the overall drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"therefore, medicines that induce or inhive CYP3A4 must be administered with caution if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure, as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore Agenerase Solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of a renal dysfunctional disorder should be low to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir."</seg>

<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug called Roferon-A which is already approved in the EU (also referred to as "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue has damages, and the results of the Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme in the blood are increased."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene (DNA), which stimulates the formation of the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"Alpheon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"in the study was measured, how many patients after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood)."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheus, the disease continued to respond to more patients than in the case of the reference drug, Alpheus had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 may not be more than 2% of the body surface to be treated."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and inhibitors the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin cells, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with Hautwunden, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (frozen cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA, or presumably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the place of the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo weigh over the risks in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Glaxo Group Ltd. to permit the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be taken into account (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of sensitizing or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"Retapamulin is not used to treat infections, where MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials of secondary infected wounds, the efficacy of reapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in humans after topical application on scratched skin or superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral application of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on a sliced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can dose adjustments are not required if topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the impact of birth and foetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">"during pregnancy, Retapamulin Salbe should be used only if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"when deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most frequently reported side effect of irritation at the administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosom which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partially blocking P-binding adjustment interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s-ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin should appear at least some infection forms, should seek advice by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily with occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"from 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However the maximum individual systemic intake was reduced to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">"Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro testing on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats microkernel test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">"there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which resulted in an up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2) sliced skin:"</seg>
<seg id="2713">"in an embryotoxicity study at rats, oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental stoicity (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined."</seg>
<seg id="2714">"the owner of the authorization for the transport must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2), works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied."</seg>
<seg id="2715">"the owner of the license fee is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"as described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human use, the updated RMP must be submitted concurrently with the next Periodic Safety Update Report."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"show irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"do not use other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not explicitly prescribed by your doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"it must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, nose or female genital area."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"if the ointment is made from clipping on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"after applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix must be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the two doses of two doses can be brought to an end."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body) as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"ambient rix contains the same components as the vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccine, which has been approved since 1997, has been approved in 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan existing from three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study involving 208 children, the vaccine efficacy was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month and a 12-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturiness and irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances or any other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">"August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals from the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for prioritization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured if immunocompetent persons, who have addressed a hepatitis B vaccination, need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection-vaccines, adequate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in cases of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody, so that further vaccination doses may be required in these cases."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"as an intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal result, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"however, in the case of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, Ambirix can be injected as an exception as it can come to bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"if Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injections at the same time with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular pertin, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB), the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"in patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there may be no sufficient immune response."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the previous thiomer salt and preservative vaccine formulation."</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturation based on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person."</seg>
<seg id="2754">"pain was observed after the ambient of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-dose combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"according to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given the Ambirix had a pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"however, the frequency of maternity was comparable high per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine)."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">"in a comparative study at 1 to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported."</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">"in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years, serum levels for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7)."</seg>
<seg id="2762">"the serum levels for anti-HBs were 74,2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7)."</seg>
<seg id="2763">"7 In a comparative study, which was conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in the 289 persons whose immunity was evaluated, the serum levels of serum (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 after receiving the 3-dose substance."</seg>
<seg id="2765">"the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table."</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those diagnosed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">A clinical study at 12- including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable to that in the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"if the first dose Ambirix was administered at the same time with a combination of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertin, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who need insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or to process insulin not effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged four to 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults in type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% was found in insulin lisper after six months."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Apidra cans have to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the inversion of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thighs or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal muscles."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can result in a change in insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A insufficient dosage or breakage of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The change of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change with the conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that can increase blood sugar levels and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, disopyllin, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamid antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation can be weakened or absent from the effects of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin lulisine enters into human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorted after oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"the following are listed from clinical studies known as adverse drug reactions, grouped according to system organclasses and arranged according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1000; &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1000); not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"Lipodystrophy Wird fails to change the injection point within the injection unit, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucoagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by an appropriately trained person or administered by a doctor with intravenous administration of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin lulisine showed proportional glucosesthetic effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionately increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisine has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was evident that an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal reaches a comparable post-prandial glycaemic control, like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"in 2 minutes before the meal, Insulinglulisin was trained in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"insulin lulisin at a dose of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal, compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B)."</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at least 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
