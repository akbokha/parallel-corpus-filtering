the module website can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Website . select from the drop @-@ down list to translate the initial and target language of the translation .
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
only web pages on the web can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself where you can insert translated texts directly .
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings extensions .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want there . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the module An@@ no@@ op filter ( also known as folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : each other node is sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects using the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View color mode , can either indicate depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or mapping of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used ( whereby the area of the tre@@ em@@ ap can be used ) . &quot;
&quot; with the tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal should not always be maintained . for tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of an entry to the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . in this case it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoiding space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can design@@ ate the minim@@ ally presented area for an entry on the menu entry View holding on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
the option Images per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of miniature images of each line in the gallery .
&quot; to display the file name of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when displaying the image size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box image size , specify whether the size of the images is displayed below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the Save In HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a rotating field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; to copy the original pictures to the gallery , copy the original pictures to the gallery . &quot;
use the check box comment file to use a comment file for cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth as in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear into media playback . &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the standard browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to run with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
this option will use the set browser recognition for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

&quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums download . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens to be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the file name or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ c is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders . &quot;
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as a base folder . no image will be changed . while browsing the folder , you get a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ess recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . you can do this by adding a point in front of the folder name .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ kl@@ ist do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and this will be used as an album icon . for more details see the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up and digi@@ ti@@ sed your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help menu . &quot;
how you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums download . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . &quot;
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that digi@@ cam images can be reliably read out . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , via the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be put in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - A file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog box .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ aison quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created , and the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it down . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to include information about this collection . to access the album properties , you &apos;ll need to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot;
album Collec@@ tions : are a method to highlight your albums so you can be group@@ ed under a common name if you want to add or delete albums from the tool@@ bar after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with view records by date .
&quot; the buttons elder , average , new ester : these set the date on one of the oldest , the latest image or that of the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and drop in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&quot; album collections have a different effect . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait for a short while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information these are , you can edit via Settings digi@@ kam ; set up . select here the Albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window to appear . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; photos are all about &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can select all the functions that are using &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select your photos as you can edit your photos and change them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button , and how to adjust them to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to click on the preview and select Rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you will keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; delete , it will be moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image dele@@ tion or Del If you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My data sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date overview , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords ; so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords , by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword &amp; quot ; or on an existing keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then click New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this becomes the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword may be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and selecting keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &apos; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , click on the picture with the right mouse button and select it as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My cat@@ ch@@ word , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &apos; ; alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this is displayed in the main window on the thumb@@ nail . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
&quot; the time beam view shows a tim@@ esp@@ an adjustable hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogra@@ m . in order to select a time frame , you only have to click the lower right angle of the selection frame to select the time unit . this displays all the related images in the main window . &quot;
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the light will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the Ri@@ der in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is performed . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the appropriate entry from my search list and select an option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select Edit Search , the search will pop up again with the search information you have previously entered . if you choose to edit Advanced search , you will find more rules to search . for more information , see the Advanced Search section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the Search context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group , or delete it . additionally , you can create a search for the type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ TH@@ ING . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the suitable pictures . here too can be set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can use the mouse wheel in or zoom out or move it . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folders .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Li@@ ghts from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and open its window .
&quot; from the preview tool@@ bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . if you are viewing preview synchron@@ izing from the tool@@ bar and performing a zoo or shifting operations on one of the pictures , you can also compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly pull out from a series of images . if you use combination @-@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lamp table like e.g. F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
all images from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function that allows you to see the visible area of the image . in the mode Pre@@ view , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the Zoom @-@ knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the mode Pre@@ view .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , review , group@@ ing , backup , classi@@ fy , backup , maintain , maintain , and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Manager accepts , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and export content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is provided in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to use inventory management for longer a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be on your computer if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . resi@@ dences can quickly be found on your location , unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for pictures you want to print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the creation page of metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you will have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , because you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an app@@ rais@@ al . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you are often called in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded stit@@ ches , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you and can easily be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be deleted by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it pursu@@ es the under@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you just want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; you can set it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , these labels will be exported to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already drives with light speed .
&quot; you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export k@@ ml files you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export k@@ ml files you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export k@@ ml files you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export k@@ ml files you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export k@@ ml files you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export k@@ ml files to Google Maps , also to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furnishing side of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be deposited :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . once it has not been desired , the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the working description of the photographer . examples of this may be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the image to others . if the image is a stock photo , then here is the group / agency that offers the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can only be of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate defects , plate failure , vol@@ tages , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection , they use chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; there is a low @-@ priced program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; you can also read the media with a description , date &amp; author identi@@ fier and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ manufacturers keep their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT may not detect this error . some of S@@ MA@@ RT errors are the most common error reason . S@@ MA@@ RT errors are the most common error reason . these are especially read errors and displacement meters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not account much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes are different . these can cause serious damage . so , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . however , remember that not every plug connector also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should pay attention to the fact that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection your system protects against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run down the system . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in current disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . at the end , you should always remember all cables to tr@@ enne before going into vacation . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; their free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ical . &quot;
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you have never thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . not@@ ebooks account for the share of th@@ ef@@ ste@@ els 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , such as theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been seen . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most widespread file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot;
&quot; even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no one responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . thus , secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash struck you are lucky if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ ral Pre@@ vention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , one more common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup is made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system , except that it is only scann@@ ed and is not continuous . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance wal@@ ker . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have created the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software to read it then you can create them yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , it should not be used anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ atic data for improved color assignments for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow compression . &quot;
&quot; it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licence @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed due to the need for camera image formats and is committed to using metadata . a handy camera operator makes DN@@ G now available and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to em@@ bed the &amp; quot ; Image resource block@@ quot ; technology of the &apos; 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file , and as mentioned above , you should think if you are using DN@@ G as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert your raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; you can use external programs for fine @-@ layer editing . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ code ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code into MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to add a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ Base . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ment indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails for each file , photos , films , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as with the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
the list of the existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . then select the Album from the list and press OK .
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all files at once by using the Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you will need to select them first and then delete selected dele@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera cher completely , you should do so using the camera sensor , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re @-@ utilized after the photos were deleted from the camera . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; during the transmission , three more options open before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % M in the edit panel . for further adjustments , use the str@@ f@@ time command to read the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information about the camera &apos;s orientation to the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , &amp; digi@@ kam can be downloaded ; this sub @-@ albums are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums on the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download the download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant in length and width and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ graph@@ ers an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; download the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iled coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to change in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing , so you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the author field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the name of the photo . this does not need to be the author , if this is an image for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be included in the picture . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; save images as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the in@@ scrip@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the option chosen , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ls ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for more details .
&quot; with setting P@@ NG compression you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TI@@ FF file option , you can un@@ fold the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just one image viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard , it is a solid color balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the tail@@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in , due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed white in the settings . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the lights to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels generally do not reproduce so quickly as green and red . &amp; rap@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure . &quot;
&quot; V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was used , it produces colour art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , as it is done during the conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the colour information from a color space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to leave for your profiles . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated , instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for what it is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . this is why a table of cameras and profiles can fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it &apos;s an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can support ; many modules supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and beyond . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings short commands . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob controls the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . at present , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you can mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer to get them in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera models and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window menu . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly accepted by &amp; digi@@ kam ; applied if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without asking questions . otherwise you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
&quot; you can also see the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; at startup , this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; if something from the base folder has been deleted , the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam will be extended . if something from the base folder has been deleted , you will be asked if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting the entry View / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; therefore you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , zoom factor , and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File menu or using the button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored , and the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Back@@ wards or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed or restored in between . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the editing process , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full@@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . whole image preview pages can be printed from your choice . you just need to select the pictures using the standard methods and choose from the menu album Ex@@ porting Prin@@ ter Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation column , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be truncated after 2000 characters and special characters will be changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling box in other applications you should observe these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword @-@ view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the key words used before in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved into the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword @-@ tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the keyword is already existing , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter stands on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created it and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can specify an advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scann@@ ers and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means you can provide information with information about color management . in addition , you should provide information with deeper information to make your own informed choices to make you the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; their only other image editions are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another color space and do thoughts about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click on info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to k@@ alli@@ ze my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; so if you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to k@@ alli@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is running on s@@ RGB . then you have to dial your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve an image in most cases . do not use it before attempting any further manual editing .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Adju@@ st@@ ment and Con@@ trast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ tive Automatic Cor@@ rection try automatically out of your colors to make the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values over the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes it generates very good results when improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic comparison : this method maximizes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad pictures .
the white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 bits per color . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it using the menu item Color white balance of the image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , the original image as well as the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adjusted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , click the sub@@ window . &quot;
the target image preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
&quot; the hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or trim down . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indication increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the Save As and Download buttons do this exactly . any setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it to a text file and re@@ charge it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button will reset all filter values back to its default values and neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires more disk space , calculation time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles . it uses the modification and allocation of color profiles . color mapping can be applied by the sub@@ window for the brightness .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to always use the same error and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; the colored , darker areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment creates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . you can use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo with poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too great satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase them . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the tool tone correction is located between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ amp / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma . even if the dialog is very complicated for this tool , you only need the scope of the slide . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the regulator and make sure the picture changes .
&quot; on the right you can view the original and preview the image . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : this selection box can be used to display the hist@@ ogra@@ m with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the settings of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
outputs : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively use the output value as the input value . the compression of the output value can be used for example to create a hidden image as a background while something else is in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . for this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of the alignment applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols are used to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a c@@ w@@ edge to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker outputs and the corresponding pixels darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and then loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sunny shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect at the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black and white photograph , which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sunny shades have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mixer der &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the image preview has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line is displayed in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are on the right side : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will keep the general brightness even if you are also activating the corresponding color components . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color to a visible rus@@ hing leads to a visible noise that does not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns are different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first . &quot;
the Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been newly adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects , and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter . &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the sh@@ ading anten@@ nas . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool texture to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper box is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
using the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . an opportunity to retain his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly embra@@ ces the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also goes to multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool template you can place a template on a picture .
the Image template use in the image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template file , simply send an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after setting the root folder for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder automatically updates the template of templates automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ ink : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image is then automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot;
&quot; elements that are smaller than the resolution are summ@@ ar@@ ised together with only minimal differences to a color point . this , in turn , causes sharp edges to be summ@@ ar@@ ised together with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; for JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the &quot; &quot; Con@@ duc@@ ting sharpen@@ ing &quot; &quot; menu item . &quot;
&quot; however , the sharp@@ ness of the edges increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is to re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focus , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu item Cor@@ ts soft and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tested . an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft switch between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and hence f@@ law errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted de@@ fl@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should give 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is g@@ auss . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ze . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try out all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ k@@ ieren uses a larger neighborhood as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
theoretically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better for processing small details .
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the focus correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area of the dark to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
&quot; the ink tin@@ ting allows an appropriate color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ing over the picture . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogen@@ ous regions and make details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should ensure that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . &quot;
&quot; direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is smooth@@ ed evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD noise , a high value will create wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best fixed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value appropriately to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . usually it ranges from 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the increase in quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to release it . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Download buttons do this exactly . any setting of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file , and then re@@ charged later . &quot;
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Canc@@ el Canc@@ el . &quot;
the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be removed with this tool successfully .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced settings window can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; a radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and allows the image to be blur@@ red . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . if you want to remove a weak h@@ ash or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically stronger . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ arity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes made in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture composition . the texture composition is carried out with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Download buttons do this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file , and then re@@ charged later . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button fastening . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera was added to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photograph which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts shown on the scann@@ ed image and the photo paper ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &quot; &quot; hot pixel &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixels ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD screens . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will notice the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark and automatically re@@ charge it at the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) , or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , in particular the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area uni@@ form@@ ly . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects can be caused by movement . &quot;
it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a cent@@ er@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tor applies the transformation with a center filter onto a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a lens adjustment of 1 , or accidentally a light intensity of 2 . increase the density by a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; adjust brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
if you want a more fine adjustment of exposure of the target image you let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correction in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a den@@ ser and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second graph treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ne @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby results in a correction of the first grade . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; clear : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ne or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any tri@@ mming or size changes . the best way to perform this correction is the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would apparently be the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the tri@@ mming tool in the menu Trans@@ forming tri@@ mming from the image processing or using the Zoom controller of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared movie of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview you can set two parameters for film and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the pointed words .
&quot; this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film basket effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited version is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the top el@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth controls the smooth@@ ing or , viewed from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage leaf . images whose gra@@ dients may change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to sket@@ ch out . these would be good pictures to start with .
&quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob sel@@ ects the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter Grav@@ ure shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells , and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks . &quot;
&quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button fastening .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ red effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
ran@@ ge@@ finder : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
cont@@ act@@ less sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : find the color bas@@ ins in the image and wi@@ pe them without alter@@ ing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells , and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button fastening . &quot;
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . you can find the tools in the menu Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming Spi@@ der . &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is below .
&quot; change the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose . enlarge Every single image for photo can be saved as text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button fastening . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut out . this way you will get a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply using the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog , remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Move to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and width is always assigned to width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are cen@@ timeter , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the combination aid enable you to mask al@@ ig@@ ns so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden middle : the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will give you good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ bow the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition results in a symmet@@ ric visual flow along the way of the viewer .
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . &quot;
&quot; its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no uniform tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . the result is a very attractive composition which you cannot reach otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ on@@ tal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the button Color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are set in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ forming tri@@ mming from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally cutting function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option gives the picture a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments make a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with trans@@ form@@ ative tri@@ mming from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the shifting tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module via Trans@@ forming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using horizontal and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are displayed to zero . a preview of the Eff@@ ect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two z@@ ations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with trans@@ form@@ ative s@@ lic@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that are familiar with . this is based on file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions , and change it . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam , supported by : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editor and therefore does not have built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit films .
go forward to the previous album in the Chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward if you have gone before .

&quot; if you swa@@ p the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can do the first four adjustment with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter onto the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can use the mouse wheel in or zoom out or move it . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled below the button Color , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be selected by selecting the check box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character , if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
choose a color anywhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that are &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are out@@ dated by the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; posters ; re@@ calcul@@ ates the graph and represents in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
&quot; further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as shown in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list has opened files . click the first icon to view the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file was modified in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . once again , you can save your choice as well as change it later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph distributed over several pages without head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; the Back Download page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file was modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time a graph is asked .
the site session management gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cs@@ v . you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or decide to be asked at every start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ s ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are : &quot;
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ app@@ ings as possible .
&quot; it produces representations in accordance with the spring @-@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; the command should specify the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify the graph file as parameters , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( judged or executed ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed and ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) .

&quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values duc@@ tile to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the image to suit your needs before using the button scanning the image . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after pressing the button scanning , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the image file will appear . here you can select the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select or create the image by saving the image . &quot;
screen Photos You can create after you have selected in the menu Import &gt; Screen Photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear for you to see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be read after a short delay , the currently visible work@@ space . if you select the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen shot has been created , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos secure and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . so it is used for your authentication , so it &apos;s just your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log into Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; just close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access permissions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue using these permissions . &quot;
&quot; using this button , you can select the photos you want to upload . using this button , you can select the photos you want to upload . when you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during loading .
&quot; with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to change the size of the photos before loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the C@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the C@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera .
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation performs the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ eren and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same location . as the dialog cap@@ tures the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and placed with the displayed card . select the region in question and expand it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Picture Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly find a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your related images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth setting , you can change the standard color depth , which of course influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail images allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . &quot;
the C@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or reloc@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the colour information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the C@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy from the main program and then enter the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied by clicking the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module also uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Sli@@ deshow . &quot;
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to use the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that you can start using Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au to launch the module .
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file in the name of the m@@ peg output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can start a coffee quickly or in all rest and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages via the button settings right down . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. : useful to improve you or print out using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have an effect . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use it , you should not select the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as memory format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to reverse all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to screen format . &quot;
non proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent in advance .
&quot; after you have launched the module , the picture window will be shown with the images that you have selected . you can add more images via the button to add images . for the last image selected , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop them there to add the list of images to be sent .
&quot; to remove images , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the images selected by you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments on the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu Image File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under image file format and are the original JPEG format files , then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . &quot;
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au a window with questions like you want to show your slides will be displayed . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card as otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it &apos;s not the order of the pictures used in the album .
&quot; the time interval between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly choosing a different effect at any transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date now has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , which is of course also for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; to do this , you will need to select the image for each individual . to do so , you will need to customize the image image window ( in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person . in the check window , you can adjust the image to your preferences and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit Search Search in the main window , a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties . you can see this dialog again on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string of characters in the field lab@@ eling or description , you can also enter a date that should be searched for ; the date can be either a part of the total file , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog choose the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . as a result , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you Dat@@ ums statistics on the pictures in your database .
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show you the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline , so you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in and the other as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the integrated version is described , which you can create via the menu File HTML ... . &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML Ex@@ ample pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . so you can avoid that information is displayed to the viewer even without a description . for example , all images are exported . you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . as a result , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; it is best to select a basic folder for all of your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really all are visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them to the final destination folder . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings just described have changed all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . you can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ in file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices available :
&quot; for the option to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Automati@@ cally move to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most of the images are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called by your database people . therefore , in the third dialog window , you &apos;ll be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and which categories it matches in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can match the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different image groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today your videos will be taken . in many places in this manual you will talk about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the upper@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the different settings are explained .
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available that can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member@@ ships , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of one middle class as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left part of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . &quot;
the modules can be called via the Mod@@ ules menu . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most of the modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself .
&quot; since the modules of several applications are used together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little were tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can label their images in albums . also if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for albums so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that just corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the preview currently . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have chosen people to view and share this . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image is taken . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on the reloc@@ ation of the images within the list : if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be m@@ apped , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located below the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item to use multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it alphabe@@ tically sorted by your categories . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame , and you can also create your own window by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you would like to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then window / hide it . this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit selection menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , you may have saved the images somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , thumb@@ nails are present , so that you can preview the images . however , you can &apos;t see these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support you in order to avoid inser@@ ting the respective CD . so , if you want to avoid irrit@@ ating the mess of your images , please buy a larger disk to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to see your little sister can increase and select the menu item everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock images , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password set to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password change in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view to private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you &apos;re all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in it . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can also configure it with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them and jump back by using the buttons picture high and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; can be changed in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
&quot; using the Min@@ us button , you can pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . using the minus button you can zoom out the zoom @-@ rect@@ angle and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the same button the zoom uses the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos will work in and zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to place on the image . at the moment , you can preview the image and view the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to preview the image and look at more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have images with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you set features on your images , they are available in your browser . you can see this in your browser . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in preview screen . if you view categories in dre preview view , you can add features to the images by simply press the letter for the character after selecting the image . this can be seen here : &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint on the picture . &quot;
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to close the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you necessarily have read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to allow you to choose the right position : &quot;
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
&quot; if you have altered properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag them with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a feasibility stage as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also store several window orders and simply switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the anchor to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the an@@ tigen to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , drag the an@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ on top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the tap into the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the summary bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the summary bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
you can save the current window view with the view window order ... save . it will show a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ ders icon The Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full pictures in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each r@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to see the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size box size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the quality combination field , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; when an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or pattern effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling is adapted to neighbouring pixels and adap@@ tively because each pixel depends on the calculated colour values .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by the pursuit of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and tested for further classification . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch on J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the related rays have not met any object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Import menu file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er does not support the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting errors , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; likewise . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . place the path to your document and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file appears in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plate .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , scale and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the ground , a floor is rendered below the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick check@@ points , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section it explains how to create and store window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created using the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the button Add and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on a level . &quot;
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should observe these important rules :
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less , see the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the focus of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the application or press the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( insert End User Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the application or enter the entry button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model view now shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can see the name in the property @-@ view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you can see settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , click App@@ ly and then enter the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should obtain the following result : &quot;
&quot; you will need to add two new attributes in the object tree . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step you should simply do , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have already understood that the ball is just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to apply the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball would float above the ground , because you moved the ground around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , use a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click Ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even when metal is not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the common file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er before ; created &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used the undo .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove commands using this option tool@@ set for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
&quot; a B@@ ump Map is a way to block rough surfaces , without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface and without modi@@ fying the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right bottom corner . if an appropriate file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for slideshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , open &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program too . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option you switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo processing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ code ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to this , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shot ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should be able to speak this language . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ shot ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can choose between these , by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display a bright color and exposure to a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; features a side@@ bar on the right edge , providing you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view these by clicking on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images .
&amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to store or save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ Proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ anen ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
when the image has been selected the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview will be selected . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before any scann@@ ed image . if &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you &apos;ll need to select Save without having a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without following a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a numerical suff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE through dialog for &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function .
you may set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands function . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
in the scripts / templates folder you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which should include any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most script languages allow remote programs and commands to execute . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . to this end strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ Change indicates that a new piece is applied . the script could now and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information on the new piece might query ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) . &quot;
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
to add an entry you can use D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the gener@@ alization of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still have a hard decision , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . &quot;
&quot; activate de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; help , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty in setting up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
use m@@ ood@@ bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; drag files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok , to start when a browser is required . &quot;
use other browsers : specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
&quot; save playlist when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored . &quot;
&quot; keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , causing the playlist window to roll up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray illustrated section . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . use the color selection for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; resume playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback will automatically continue with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen Display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog to select color selection . if own colors do not use , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear . &quot;
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
search sub @-@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collections ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected there is more set up in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to insert the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the cart@@ el card last@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you can enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send playing pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be viewed at the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
most of the time this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes while editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
if you use K@@ DE using ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system or use at least no value of 1 second .
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
most installation problems are easiest by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the Channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error , if you have something to fix a defect in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the interface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Show rating . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this will also work if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : which media types supports g@@ asp@@ iring / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support even text and pn@@ g deco@@ ding ! &quot;
&quot; the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another link ( e.g. shock sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do not forget that media need to be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want to listen to a white noise . g@@ asp@@ amer is the best choice for most people , if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . g@@ asp@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . activate sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause distorted playback . read this error report . the enlar@@ ging of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; g@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with the folder @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you get arous@@ ed by the soft sounds of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ters and titles of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input key after a search in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search returns .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what does it look like with the icon in the Control bar &apos;s system section ? &quot;
&quot; click on the name of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . you can select a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , go to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , use files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous valuation with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can change the valuation for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the valuation of a piece by clicking on the item and edit : comment or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan , which is not compatible with the short @-@ term attached plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok that some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing animation in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane allows you to monitor &amp; control of &amp; Amar@@ ok , while browsing the kon@@ quer@@ or . start kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu . &quot;
audio @-@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio @-@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ asp@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a hint of Mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to act the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok again . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
&quot; set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output , enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . we will be happy to answer any questions regarding this apartment in English . &quot;
&quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable m@@ map in the sound@@ card . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be over@@ looked . &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag entries from the collections browser to the playlist . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection and you have the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD tracks in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button to play . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have different options to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages will be listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok , a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok can be used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a running text display showing the current current piece or current stream . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can change by the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the Player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , larger window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also on the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used for setting up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to start the play position or volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . as soon as you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that there is no other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted by context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has now been divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; moreover , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window shows information about the just running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
&quot; the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Rec@@ ommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can select which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ts - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Album - The songs will be arranged according to the artist , and this is the best view of your collection . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is used . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre , and among them according to interpre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; using the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically detect your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar you find a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . see the section about using this filter in this manual .
&quot; the search filter is a selection box that lets you filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . furthermore , you can of course also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically disabled . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This puts the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can get the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ es - this feature will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
&quot; save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name , under which the list is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; transfer the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - Therefore , the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files to the bin , open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
the album will then no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes handling many play@@ lists easy . among other things , it includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be used with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by performer sorted in the top list view of the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . this way , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar you find a search field with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and enter the input key , you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert accidental files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place . in order to reset the filter , press the back button for a long time until the text field is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field does not , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , put a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
&quot; the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can display in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration via this menu .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about play@@ lists . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar option in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . using this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the Cover Administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; the queue management will open you over extras queue management . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also change the pieces with the mouse or change the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audio @-@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them into the playlist window or click on them and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and playlist mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece from your collection . the Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist Edit opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens for editing the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be passed and you won &apos;t be able to hear it in this playlist . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists listed . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package will be installed for installation . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete and then uninstall it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ting section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization @-@ Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to track the steps , you must have a flu@@ ffy installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re @-@ coding to MP3 you will get worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you have to insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original is finished into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules can &apos;t be found . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and you can get feedback on community help from the forums and learn new news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns any kind of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ o- and En@@ co@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder Module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 Decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces will be played differently lou@@ dly . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to boot from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on an entry to open the project .
&quot; if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is shown with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call storage for each project file .
&quot; when a project is changed and not saved yet , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to be done . you can then cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it as if you would have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file locks .
&quot; when you call this record , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only open if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . it is useful for you to view files and folders already existing on the medium .
this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively you can only create a copy of a CD , which you want to burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the firing button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even ways to modify the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog for changing the key settings for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and for fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the way of your task is decisive , which of the accompanying programs you give preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume you can use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program . to use the D@@ CO@@ P command line , you must first ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
&quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project via the command line using # D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on enco@@ der installed on the machine .
&quot; currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ye c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these enco@@ der packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily usage to read a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , and everything is manually captured . &quot;
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data will start on request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be produced . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup catalogue - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; exit ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . hi@@ ring you must go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common ones . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , as both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate for about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good pleasure for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the button -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translation : this is meant by the author ) I &apos;m not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent any damage to the artist or the music business . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fal@@ si@@ fied ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for saving the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders are found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; check the device description of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , write and read real on and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; which needs to be repeated for any reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any reading of a &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the cart@@ el card General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as animated / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen shot . &quot;
&quot; in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD download the data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , it is set to be selected with fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following card map . &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . this setting will work first . &quot;
&quot; both function equally on the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to release the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this folder , then / has to specify the path / folder where the files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bs . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; day ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of concur@@ rent wa@@ v files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create a connection to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is set up . the process described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use one &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successful from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then check in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers to Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will appear and you can select the database entry that will best match your opinion to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments in@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data like in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will switch off the selection of the piece or press the button all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
&quot; if you click on the button selection to start reading the reading process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to turn on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error message if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . therefore , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will pop up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . resp@@ . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de package . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people who compile source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you want to read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need to do those informations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the procedure used .
&quot; when you exit &amp; chill ; during the playing of a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Canc@@ el in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces they are added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no lyrics at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song so that you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the entries in the menu items or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI Files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section , you will see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then selecting the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired one in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add a song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if Automati@@ cally Add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next Song button , select the next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the Pre@@ vious piece button , select Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow button on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events are translated into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the table sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . for this purpose , use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( rif@@ le shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is its presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the perc@@ ussions channel . see the included key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , just do it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , all events will be ignored in the file name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied with the value n , this is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al com@@ mas are available . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which gets a pitch @-@ nam@@ ing event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole number of cla@@ vi@@ aturen ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos , you see which sounds are being played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob does not flash green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played notes . view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can be played on two different devices with very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without having to add them to a collection , turn the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ .@@ Zu@@ first you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ .@@ Your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage me to program on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used for playing video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;

&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category persistent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the attached entry . &quot;
&quot; the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player directory can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player directory can be changed by an editor , but also through the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without the same playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; S@@ MB , some functions can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation on startup and exit can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ ME ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / DATA@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp;
&quot; there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ MB ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set up from the network and other things . &quot;
&quot; another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here , the output of mp@@ layer is visible . &quot;
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ co@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ ME ; it can even be played the special em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is called pop @-@ up ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that a given back@@ end is always taken for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; you can play TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before a TV can be viewed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be used . this can be done manually from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog can be found in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . the encoding must be found there ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player only can use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;

there are hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to run as user root after connecting the device . it is essential to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; kick ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used for the package &amp; ly@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be included .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users do not need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the Ki@@ le website should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or comp@@ iling from &amp; Ki@@ le , please refer to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy to use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management need to be called . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn how to use the manual for Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the ur@@ passed &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; for example H. Kop@@ ka , P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ end@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick @-@ Up Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers a number of options for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they must be selected only in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry . it is just a short description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want to have gr@@ asp@@ ed areas of a green text on the screen , it will still be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and overhead . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le , an empty line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) will automatically be created ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the box settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the submission of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex file , you can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files . as soon as a DVI ; file is an independent file ( constra@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the commercial output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when looking for an item in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; file was cli@@ cked , the exact opposite of it . as soon as a paragraph in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is j@@ umped in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
master Docum@@ ent : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is converted to &quot; &quot; n@@ der@@ mis &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; w@@ ading &quot; &quot; and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large open selection fields were to be noticed . the selection fields were developed for the quick introduction of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field For further information on articles such as keywords , joint marks or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or another element is created . &quot;
cover : used for reference to a specified name ( choice over a sel@@ ector ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; written by hand .
&quot; the last selection box with the name &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e &quot; &quot; is used for defining the font size . it can be used to specify the font size for the main text , the base notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses according to the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the Quick @-@ Building button . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for storing it automatically .
&quot; if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if it is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ .@@ environment ) is a text which is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have created another font . &quot;
the changes are only taken within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many options to determine the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ist pressure and is until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ised .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background has been written to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows : &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for legi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converting or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
the tool@@ bar displays the conversion of the DVI file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files .
&quot; if you want to select the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then click &quot; &quot; cli@@ cked &quot; . &quot; the jump to the corresponding position in DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot;
this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and set to the corresponding line . for this &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if there is no error in using the fast @-@ making of the &amp; DVI ; viewer , an error can be present . if there is an error , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file always displays the source code in the source code . in the editor you can see the faulty La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between the errors . in order to view the faulty line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from the ground up or the wizard will be used for quick creation of a new document . for more information on this , please refer to the section . &quot;
&quot; templates users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be open or create a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way you must take the following steps :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the standard one . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and be carried through the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and accentu@@ ating many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to learn his choices , the manual is to be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called over the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; they can be used as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex word . this means that when you click \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par will be selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with checked left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the different types of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional diving marks within the text . this is an own type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu item can also be used to highlight the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . in doing so , this jumping mark is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a sign . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; kate ; already excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is added ; special commands for selecting a &amp; lat@@ ex ; include the following commands for selecting text : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also has an extended meaning , as this command also has an extension ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for the noise of a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; C@@ trl ; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility . using Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to remove the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit paragraph paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is before or within the \ \ begin { surrounding } command , j@@ umped to the end of the area ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the over@@ looked environment can quickly be lost . this command includes the last open environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . using the Edi@@ ting Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from the editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly ending bracket .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex group # , the other end of the group is spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
this command includes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex groups is not destroyed .
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple calls for use are used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple calls . also for the end of the application , the sign is used . &quot;
this automatic insert of double calls can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; there can also be language @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , as well as German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments , and then arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &quot;
&quot; even though a good source of source code is already available , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; three different modes are built for automatic execution . all of these modes can be configured for different modes of work under Settings . &quot;
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when selecting the button , the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list of letters can be changed . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jumping tok@@ ens can be inserted and the desired parameters can be entered . &quot;
&quot; settings can be set up to these lists . there can be various list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as guar@@ dians of the general language use can be selected . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . it will always have a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full edit mode over the menu item or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by checking the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this has been completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be entered . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Con@@ ver@@ sible settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of execution mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of noti@@ fications that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be executed . for example a query list is used for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; mode has been replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large open walls are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many walls are written more than once . there@@ with &amp; Ki@@ le ; the execution for all already written walls . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the box Settings ... Ki@@ le can be completely de@@ ported . here , the threshold value for the display of the execution can also be specified . &quot;
&quot; the execution files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the Graphics dialog designs the introduction of graphics as simple as possible . in view of the basic principles of graphics formats , the sections should be followed and taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new arrangements from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in groups in the creation , compilation , converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used with Alt ; 2 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time . &quot;
a new project will be submitted to the Men@@ Ã ¼ Project New Project .... This is where the following information is requested for the project :
&quot; when you exit the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents &amp; boxes ; delivered documents and here a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for package names or banners . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working space environment .
&quot; many thanks to those who are striving for the progress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is read by &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day you use it with different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this way you will receive a file ; empty signature ; in the signature section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like , then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then Rem@@ ove in the File menu or click the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to change a short command , select an action from the list . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the User &apos;s button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;
clicking on a call stack in the shown list will offset the cursor in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file .

you can choose none or more settings from the Settings dialog . each setting is supported by a help window on the effect .
you can add no or more parameters over the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt parameter section of the dialog . this allows the transfer of parameter values to the style template .
&quot; in order to apply the changes made , click the O@@ k button . &quot;
the dialog can be closed by checking X in the right upper corner of the window . if the settings are to be changed you open the dialog again .
&quot; as soon as the style template is started , the Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ ection menu can be selected ... then click on the Save Points tab , as in the example below . &quot;
a fil@@ en@@ ame can be an absolute path to a local file . or just the file name ( eg ; x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl ) .
&quot; a template or model name can be a fully qualified name , whereby the non @-@ local part is optional , e.g. x@@ sl : my@@ template is already called by my@@ template &quot;
&quot; first , click the delete point in the list of the current holding points . then press the button Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; the status of a specific holding function is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color . the desired color can be selected : see the Edit menu Settings dialog , on the page colors . &quot;
&quot; you can disable , disable or delete a stop using buttons , the Deb@@ u@@ g menu or symbols in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; will be taken off and either in the stage manager ... dialog or in &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window . the following exceptions apply to this rule :
&quot; the various tools are available via the Deb@@ ug@@ gen menu , whereby the stage management tool is most important . &quot;
clicking from step @-@ by @-@ step results in the menu will display a dialog for selecting the running speed .
&quot; to stop the process , press the W button or select gradual exec@@ uting in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to track a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; catalog , select System ID ... in the menu and specify the value to be searched in the dialog displayed . &quot;
&quot; to post a Pub@@ lic@@ ID , select Pub@@ lic@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the dialog to be searched . &quot;
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the tab source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ S@@ LT ; source files included by the &amp; X@@ S@@ LT ; file or their members are listed here .
clicking on a source entry in the shown list will offset the text poin@@ ter in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the tab source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all found templates are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ S@@ LT are valid . therefore several templates can be present with the same agreement and mode details .
clicking on a template in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
&quot; local and global variables are shown on a card in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g @-@ In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT source code , where a global and local variable is declared . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a specific expression , for example &quot;
&quot; if it contains , a new X@@ Path can be selected by typing a new value for the variable expression and clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable order in the list , the text poin@@ ter will be transferred to the corresponding line of this file in the main window . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub@@ structure . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows mein@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we lift it one piece , we give it a graphical user interface ! no longer reli@@ ed on a terminal ; just click the symbol for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the w@@ rist@@ y working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , you can simply select the current working folder . if not , select current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be checked by means of other file - file cho@@ oser . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check option . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file sel@@ ector . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have la@@ yed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not wait until someone uses the wizard in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to locate the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniquely identify .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone is working on or sending a message when a file is added to the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; events can be created , edited , and deleted on the Site Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project settings dialog . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees in the recipient list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
you can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or select the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the chosen nick@@ name of the team member , should be given the respective area or sub @-@ project names as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses are invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after another .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car completion , it can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; big / Small @-@ writing tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower case of attributes : large / small writing of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional Tags : if attached , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically update the start and end tag : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters to the corresponding encoding during typing .
&quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default settings can be restored . &quot;
standard character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise open files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; generates regular backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changes of M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ able command line parameter .
the warning messages section serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of non @-@ poll@@ s .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in divided mode . see the different modes .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action makes it possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins are K@@ part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; loading component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ read mode &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the inserted information is correct . select also when the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment but it should be installed later .
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been implemented , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented which allows different implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will trigger the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ g@@ gers . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal cases it is not necessary to pay attention . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; initi@@ ates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line running . if this happens , the execution will be continued . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; initi@@ ates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without providing information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible , in functions and include . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there is not the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a K@@ part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find at htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for marker and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the Tag @-@ languages and family 2 , the Script languages and &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are easy to insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or generated automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag displays the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without risk of a writer . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that is group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to define . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end one day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear , with simple instructions to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP will be described ; the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for accessible via DT@@ D Edi@@ te DT@@ D settings . to edit a &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; to create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut to this action . by clicking on the user button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the defined settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot;
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be input to the default input . in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the default error output , can be specified by setting the output sel@@ ector output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in the given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all the required fields and add the tag to the right tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit tag &quot; if available , so that an entry when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least signal a message to the user that clicking this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to tool@@ bar , or you should set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . set the tool@@ bar to set dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please make sure your tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is left to you , the second we will handle here . &quot;
&quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
&quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
notice the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the shaft depth ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder shown ! ) .
&quot; whit@@ esp@@ ace influence nothing , but be sure &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , resource files . &quot;
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file used to create context sensitive help . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ator resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for your private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resource dialog , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scrip@@ ting tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions Line : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you have to famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local , and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . it stores all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use that user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the cart@@ on guides with information and the tool@@ bars . please consult , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document matching entries , e.g. rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS orders to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that drives &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu shown . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking on the right mouse button , other functions are available , such as launching , editing , or sending e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree @-@ views . with it , man@@ a@@ geable attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the system @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can create pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , send the tool@@ bar as a compressed t@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to do this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the most amazing web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer in pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim , must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why do anyone else develop ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase dramatically . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened , this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .

displays the symbol column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .

loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
actions must be saved by means of Settings . actions must be saved by means of Settings . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
&quot; enables high loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access them . &quot;

&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of a tool@@ bar , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;

&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;

&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as for example after filling the project name , the entire directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file will be filled out automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project have to be attached . if a project is started from scratch , not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection for good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) can be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . in order to read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ by can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by holding its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; event actions can be activated , changed or deleted in the event configuration under Event Con@@ figuration . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as securing a file . see details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . &quot;
to open another project select Project ... from the Menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be shown and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders also behave , but the entries Open and Open are missing ... in the context menu calling the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
&quot; if only a profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the disk storage option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply exit the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; to file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best viewed via the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool bars is handled at the bottom in the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , which results in the dialog where you can specify which actions to be visible on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries actions will be removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set Settings . set .
&quot; templates are basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary Tem@@ plates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents can be found in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as local template ... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , notice that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click on a folder to the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically use &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to define the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be configured in such a way , the b@@ lah would appear in this path . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows previous or specified text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows a whole presentation to be presented in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers for a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ elier of &amp; PHP ; source . it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time , the changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is already activated . pressing F@@ 9 is enabled by pressing a window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be adjusted using Settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . when selecting V@@ PL ; you can automatically select the time period . in principle , a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used for the reduction of the manual coding . thus , one can change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is possible , like in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor is peculiar . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or removed key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other anch@@ oring tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the She@@ ets Wiz@@ ard or the Li@@ sts Wiz@@ ard are disabled . later , they will work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . unlike other styles for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing . &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , in a position loaded in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded style or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a file name without a path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is possible for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl is possible :
this command is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ mise named QNAP or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ P@@ cloud that contains the string template .
any nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text fast , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of co@@ d and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merged : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check the code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other one differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
you can use the form below to send an email directly .
&quot; open dialog lets you manually type fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , select or merge folders . if you select a folder , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is checked , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before starting the merge / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d need to create two corresponding files , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , insert and compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , you can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( for example C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the points where the source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is scored on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) has also an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must be resolved manually at the same time . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
&quot; sometimes , the automatic merge or manual editing does not leave any more line left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; K@@ 1 row in the queue will be displayed . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking which you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if the sources ignore the options , ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments may also be treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the display window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insertion button , you can switch between insertion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the section merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / first / last difference , to the next / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture Up / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture Up / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to automatically copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . but be careful with this option , as you may be over@@ writing the clip@@ board content . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line slot token \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not use the line @-@ ends of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically during the ending and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered straight . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press or return input , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a cart reset &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could save files with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but then this option may be disabled . in default , this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , the numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; looking intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful when white characters are less important in many files .
these options are handled in the chapter on scanning the folders and performing a merge . see for details on the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart so that the change will become active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally through the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; using the encoding areas for coding , a brief reference appears what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
turn off this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will display a second over@@ see column with the information you need . &quot;
sometimes you &apos;d rather want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function e.g. for cutting out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is only used by default . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
&quot; * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like those regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case important data destruction . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders in recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate the merge and shows the simul@@ ated changes without really performing them
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will find a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - button , or double @-@ clicking on the object and fold out all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or open all folders . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow and black columns . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . for folders , age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , becomes red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; a and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if the files are merged together and select the newer file instead of merge ( in@@ secure ) , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not eliminated , mer@@ ging the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , one file after the other is processed . the status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge operation was successful , and accordingly other messages , if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if a full @-@ time analysis is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target , B and / or B are used as target and when synchron@@ izing , A and / or B is used . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the target folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries might be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears to indicate the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options through @-@ through , simul@@ ating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you first want to see what would happen , without really making changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , then select / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged together , these entries will not be merged again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the indicated pattern are displayed in the panel tree . there can be several patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder @-@ specific can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a previous dot is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ essions ) . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders with a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
the files are considered to be identical when copying the date of change . this can be useful e.g. when copying the date of change . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
&quot; synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders will subsequently be identical . the results of merge files will also be stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed .@@ orig@@ .@@ If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can disable the option directory and text window and switch between the directory and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder . however , you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . to do this , use the current file merge directly , and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relative . or contain . it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change of change . therefore , permissions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 then press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3 part view from the context menu .
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . in addition , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode . &quot;
&quot; there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is compact ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who went this way or going to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from sources and probably did not tell the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical . however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this was too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c has been removed , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options . )
&quot; if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button again . &quot;
in default this option is de@@ activated . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both within a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running therein . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; moving is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries . &quot;
maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is ti@@ cked together with name , the names will be provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , as from P@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch @-@ down sel@@ ector ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do it manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root and assign it to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you will need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users , including artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following this window is called magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , the area around the mouse poin@@ ter looks like a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can use a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still unable to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default value ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it using the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press or press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the top left corner of the drop window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy into a file , copy into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the display update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your typ@@ ed short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , new ads ( using the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and smaller &amp; etc ; . &quot;
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use an area of the screen so you would use a magni@@ fier to use the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual disability .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while at the same point . it &apos;s meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click pains . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while at the same point . it &apos;s meant to em@@ ulate people who suffer pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) , but this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the mouse button is pressed . drag the mouse , wait until the mouse button is pressed . this way , you can drag the mouse to the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . the smart shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this residence time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before the mouse button is closed again , if no moving of the mouse takes place in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function is activated , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or the finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shifting in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer termin@@ ate by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . however , if you want to place a mouse poin@@ ter on a neutral area of your desktop if you want to have a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the tit@@ le@@ bars of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy and paste it into the clip@@ board , or execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using the k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , every time you click &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button p@@ ushes a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows must be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button once the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program was developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and which the an@@ tigen of the mouse buttons is pain@@ ed .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can also be carried out with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sets from a list with the conversation history to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialo@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text book . from the text passages , you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so only correctly sp@@ elled words can be incorporated into the word . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a run memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; you can enter the sentences which you want to hear in the input field . each spoken proposition is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets of sentences , which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page wor@@ shipping and the site K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the text box input field , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding with which the text is passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator as standard input .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you can find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ops language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant speech , the selected text passage is spoken directly and in addition to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of into the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text message book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text message book will not be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , select before saving , &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; using buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can specify the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , in the course of time , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the sequence of text passages or passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar by default . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is displayed , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is displayed , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default the tool@@ bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page and enter the voice output command . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
&quot; festival is a language edition system of Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to display an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without any restrictions .
&quot; to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low up the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as default must be enabled .

&quot; since the voice generator is setting only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ops as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to set the settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , let text output through the computer . it stores a list of already spoken pro@@ positions which the user can spend again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer included . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows every application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; speech output takes place via the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher , the various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc ; . &quot;
allows creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
&quot; Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows offering T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set up kt@@ ops above kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ops . you can also subscribe to the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de access . &quot;
&quot; before you can use the program , you need to install and adjust speech dis@@ cards . &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the anti@@ trust card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the map card is shown in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
different actors for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printer sp@@ ik@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ el card rider Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the anti@@ trust card speaker will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already set speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ as ; system .
&quot; choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; almost always use . go back to the map tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start reading text .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab tool@@ bar General to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to activate the kt@@ ops ; this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card will be displayed and the T@@ TS @-@ System by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when t@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , provided that the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ l@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; you can start , stop , stop and resume text orders with the buttons in this series . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board read or open a text file to preview . you can also change the speaker for an order .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the cart@@ el card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click General and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text that should be read and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check the text that should be read , and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , noti@@ fying you about events established by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you may be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel , where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the I@@ RC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a K@@ Noti@@ fy program , a menu entry appears in the menu Settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; you can remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of kt@@ ops ; . for normal work with kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the program speech dispat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you get from the card ticket orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader during &amp; t@@ ts ; just one such reading , this issue is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages , and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; re@@ formers use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; for example , if you have selected a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE @-@ Nachrichten about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text assignment , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing through the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and you will see the following setup dialo@@ gs below . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it must differ only from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replacing .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl ; button at the click of the mouse .
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered copied .
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the character translation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the u@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls package . &quot;
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the microphone selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the anti@@ trust card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can , for example , specify that texts from a female voice should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text is transferred to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that the program pres@@ ets , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops . with the microphone selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it with a click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to get faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the microphone selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the case Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , which programm@@ ers can add to their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice @-@ sharing services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ forwarding .
&quot; text of text to preview and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console windows ; window . start kt@@ s@@ d in one window , then kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the named language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ trans@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that entire sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ cat@@ fish . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ops have their own license , which can be found in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can delete the pack@@ et with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can download it . also , you will find the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; for many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html project page . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ u ; to use another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded , translate and install the source code from &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source code archive or downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
before using &amp; kt@@ u ; first check if speech dispat@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr which uses the program speech dispat@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr program is to be developed so that the creation of speech dispat@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat the sentence or paragraph , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender feminine , it is used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker chooses , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; for example , the box for Inter@@ active Festival Inter@@ active is shown below . for details on the modules , see below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . if you are aware that Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some control and display this grey , the voice selected by you does not allow you to set these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed t@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is selected and kt@@ l@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the currently processed set . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and t@@ t@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card icon . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed . output of screen readers , warnings and messages will not be displayed . more information about the message types by &amp; kt@@ u ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use g@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 % corresponds to about half and 200@@ rpm , about double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ as ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are reading &amp; eg ; just reading a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome anyone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ u ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen re@@ actors there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start reading with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch the preview of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , where a sound is played , are not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops ; ignored . &quot;
use this check@@ box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event hits . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you select a user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the flash@@ card speaker . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) .
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the messages into a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to select text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ mm , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , you can start or pause on the first set , as only the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support it directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a default , a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will be advised . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn pron@@ unciation is to choose the language of speaking . switch on the selection of the speakers and select the text to read . to do so , you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; then start reading faster with pre @-@ reading , as only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long &quot;
&quot; if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this feature , you will be able to pause or cancel orders on the card card . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal sentence recognition filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . change nothing to this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering .
&quot; BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ts ) , warning messages , messages or output of screen re@@ actors . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ seeing the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card selection menu , you can over@@ write the speech settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the flash@@ card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; using the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker that is most likely the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box , if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings . &quot;
&quot; since language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a prime feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the language attribute is present , if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that of the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the field speaker , which is most likely to er@@ ase the following , click on the default speaker , and then use speaker , which is most likely the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without the order number the input is required 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; t@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes and kt@@ ops ; one . on the &amp; console , a message appears that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . see the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ops / cap@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / cap@@ tion . as a guide , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developer . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and set up via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Inter@@ active offer themselves a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML transformation filter , and set the speech speed up . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order to make the festival no mistakes , the x@@ sl file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added an own drawer filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ u ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the cart@@ el rider orders it is displayed ; the job consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; you may not filter out pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , call@@ sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by calling the command @-@ register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience conflicts with AL@@ SA in the audio output . if your system is also part of it , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; also freezes when you have a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; download &amp; kt@@ ops ; as tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request . &quot;
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of these have a running time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; default is not installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; before using the syn@@ thesizer , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
you must install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / c@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , select Festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ish like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
&amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . the required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be created from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the Fol@@ der Festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival of &quot;
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 you don &apos;t need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the right path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German festival . &quot;
this process uses special code to give the language over festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; to get and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work . then download Festival Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the lex@@ icon . the exec@@ utable file Festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . &quot;
the command module enables you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any language syn@@ thesizer installed in one &amp; console ; can be controlled on the command line .
use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured already , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases device drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option Network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the setting not to re @-@ ask , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the full functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed .
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced settings displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are sent to the system at the same time with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information with each system start . in the drop @-@ down list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the IP address , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on demand . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . disable a enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be added , removed or changed by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with kno@@ bs Hin@@ ds or Her@@ bs in priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
select an entry from the group calcul@@ ator and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will be shown .
&quot; the list of know@@ ingly known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of Nam@@ ed hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog acquain@@ tance machine will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of the static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediate in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set in one &amp; console . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net where you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but also the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is communicated in a small ( home ) network . &quot;
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely distributed . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is assign@@ able . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the network administrator the contact point , which has a valid IP address or if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a special area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks of up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a separate lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot;
in this part are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is no other content to be found there in case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is re @-@ sorted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ formal &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first one was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take , if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; pack the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ect on the tape do not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be re @-@ created . &quot;
&quot; when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape is format@@ ted before use , it must be format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives do not require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives are not format@@ ted . &quot;
after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape continue . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
&quot; before starting the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save In the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the backup dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu item to check ....
&quot; once the verification process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can once again review your selection and change the working folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restart the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog opens for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again review your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog will appear again . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in the same file system are saved , such as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be found separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent from the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ itting &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will be loaded to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ector in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , it is automatically ej@@ ected by the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy disks . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat , to change the hardware block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , whereby host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be run directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar administr@@ atively . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system stores the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can access information about problems appearing on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen shot , &amp; k@@ system log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - to open the system protocol , and it opens itself instead of it a small news window , so you have not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually not found in the / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected criterion . in default , the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , select the column process and enter the name of a process in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , so shows you &amp; k@@ system log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . minutes of the level errors will be displayed with a conspic@@ uous color as minutes of the level hint . the colored representation of minutes lines can be dis@@ connected setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to show just a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu in order to display all new add @-@ on lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ ins@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the System V In@@ it rapidly develops into the standard for controlling program start @-@ ups in the &amp; Linux world . and , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following other folders :
&quot; system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be launched once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks in@@ it at various points after the program and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can repair it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name and if it contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have a server running level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts between run@@ level@@ n or alter the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of availability system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ bo@@ oting . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; available for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end without notice if their configuration files are not present or set up correctly . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; after you have made changes , you will need to save them . either use the corresponding tool@@ bar icon or record in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user / group properties . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is created where you can make individual settings . other card cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card password management appears , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , are installed like in BSD . &quot;
&quot; this card list only appears if there is limited space limitation for at least one integrated file system ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the limited space restrictions are in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the array file system with restricted space restriction .
&quot; the card group informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or group or click the Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group will be an@@ alog@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ System Manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , remove the time until bo@@ oting the standard operating system , remove , remove , modify , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more . &quot;
