<seg id="11">The module Annoop filter (also known as folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools View filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: each other node is sub-elements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects using the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"& FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified. accordingly, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can either indicate depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or mapping of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby the area of the treemap can be used)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"with the treemap in & FSView, this goal should not always be maintained. for treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as splitting the area of an entry to the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. in this case it is always advantageous for labeling and avoiding space losses through frames so that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods are lines, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can designate the minimally presented area for an entry on the menu entry View holding on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="56">"you can use them to view, comment and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules."</seg>
<seg id="57">"although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow."</seg>
<seg id="58">"improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or the lens to be searched for."</seg>
<seg id="59">"like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means, it depends on the support of the end users."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this opens a dialog with an underlined link. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report."</seg>
<seg id="61">"& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you start & digitised; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the file name or click the folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abc is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digikam; will also use as an albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, which contains images, as a base folder. no image will be changed. while browsing the folder, you get a progress indicator like this:"</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; duress recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. you can do this by adding a point in front of the folder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenklist do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and this will be used as an album icon. for more details see the albums section."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up and digitised your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in & digikam; albums download. of course, every medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">"modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link)."</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that digicam images can be reliably read out. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbauma, via the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be put in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- A file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenliaison quot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created, and the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it down. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to include information about this collection. to access the album properties, you'll need to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to highlight your albums so you can be grouped under a common name if you want to add or delete albums from the toolbar after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with view records by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the buttons elder, average, new ester: these set the date on one of the oldest, the latest image or that of the average of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and drop in the context menu & quot; As an album preview". "in addition, you can drag the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">"album collections have a different effect. you can, of course, use both methods to organize your photos."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"if you open an album the first time, you need to wait for a short while while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by recreating all thumbnails in the Tools menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information about each image is displayed below the associated preview. what information these are, you can edit via Settings digikam; set up. select here the Albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window to appear. the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>

<seg id="102">"it may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button, and how to adjust them to your needs if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual."</seg>
<seg id="103">"some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc."</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way to click on the preview and select Rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>

<seg id="110">"when a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="111">"tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keywords; so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also re-import your keywords in other programs."</seg>
<seg id="113">"you can add new keywords, by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword & quot; or on an existing keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then click New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this becomes the substitchword of this keyword."</seg>

<seg id="140">"another mode is better suited to quickly pull out from a series of images. if you use combination-wise navigating from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar images."</seg>
<seg id="141">"of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lamp table like e.g. F4 file..."</seg>

<seg id="145">"digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos takes up, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way."</seg>
<seg id="146">"we will give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, review, grouping, backup, classify, backup, maintain, maintain, and export image files."</seg>
<seg id="147">"& quot; Digital Stock Manager accepts, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and export content that has a monetary or cultural value."</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is provided in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">"I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't need to use inventory management for longer a specific photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use not & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure. your image files must somehow be on your computer if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">"you might be happy with this structure. residences can quickly be found on your location, unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is then a folder for pictures you want to print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">"we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the creation page of metadata in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu."</seg>
<seg id="156">"now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do this, & digikam; you will have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones."</seg>

<seg id="297">"with setting PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression."</seg>
<seg id="298">"with the TIFF file option, you can unfold the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the default algorithm works lossless."</seg>
<seg id="299">"with the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning."</seg>
<seg id="300">"in previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just one image viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing."</seg>
<seg id="301">"if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">"this setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard, it is a solid color balance, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight."</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the taillights, so the parts of your images are burned-in, due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed white in the settings. finally, you can try some parts of missing information from the lights to reconstruct."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels generally do not reproduce so quickly as green and red. & rapw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the Reconstructing option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively."</seg>
<seg id="309">"a Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data, which have many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure."</seg>
<seg id="310">"VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. as if AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was used, it produces colour artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanners and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the theme is on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means you can provide information with information about color management. in addition, you should provide information with deeper information to make your own informed choices to make you the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">"their only other image editions are via e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another color space and do thoughts about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click on info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to kallize my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"so if you work in the sRGB color space or not, you need to kalliate your monitor, since sRGB is running on sRGB. then you have to dial your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>
<seg id="387">Notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve an image in most cases. do not use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Adjustment and Contrast extend from the menu Corrective Automatic Correction try automatically out of your colors to make the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the brightness values over the entire image, making the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced."</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the luminosity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes it generates very good results when improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 bits per color. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the menu item Color white balance of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, the original image as well as the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, click the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The target image preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or trim down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indication increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the Save As and Download buttons do this exactly. any setting of the white balance you have set, you can save it to a text file and recharge it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button will reset all filter values back to its default values and neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires more disk space, calculation time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles. it uses the modification and allocation of color profiles. color mapping can be applied by the subwindow for the brightness.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to always use the same error and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction, you will find further information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digicode; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible. another upliftment creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopaper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon light. in case of large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. you can use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo with poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too great saturation. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase them. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"the tool tone correction is located between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchamp / Contrast / Gamma. even if the dialog is very complicated for this tool, you only need the scope of the slide."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the regulator and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right you can view the original and preview the image. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: this selection box can be used to display the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammasts."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinboards can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the settings of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Outputs: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively use the output value as the input value. the compression of the output value can be used for example to create a hidden image as a background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. for this, the Gimp level format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect at the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below is an example of the alignment applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the original and the target image are displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, two symbols are used to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a cwedge to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker outputs and the corresponding pixels darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be saved in the filesystem and then loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"when you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sunny shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel exposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect at the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">"below you can see a black and white photograph, which was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sunny shades have been set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2)."</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer der & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The image preview has a red marker. if you position it in the image a vertical line is displayed in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates particularly in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psycho-ovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">"elements that are smaller than the resolution are summarised together with only minimal differences to a color point. this, in turn, causes sharp edges to be summarised together with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"for JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the" "Conducting sharpening" "menu item."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, the sharpness of the edges increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is to refocus the tool. under refocus, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften with the menu item Corts soft and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tested. an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft switch between the tones are excluded from sharper and hence flaw errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the fuzzy mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicode; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted deflation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauß'sche folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should give 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is gauss. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauze. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try out all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharp Maskieren produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp maskieren uses a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:"</seg>

<seg id="514">"the ink tinting allows an appropriate color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogenous regions and make details sharp. a value of 0.9 should ensure that no sharpening is necessary afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value is smoothed evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD noise, a high value will create wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best fixed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value appropriately to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. usually it ranges from 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the increase in quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to release it."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the Save As and Download buttons do this exactly. any setting of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file, and then recharged later."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Cancel Cancel."</seg>

<seg id="535">"a radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and allows the image to be blurred."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. if you want to remove a weak hash or JPEG artifacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and loaded later."</seg>

<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the top elects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooth controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the hingness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicode; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage leaf. images whose gradients may change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to sketch out. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">"there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100, to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob selects the contrast (smoothing)."</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicode; Filter Gravure shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">"the filter Gravur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monstrous landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">"wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells, and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks."</seg>
<seg id="612">"wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks."</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button fastening.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurred effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Rangefinder: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">This creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Contactless sharpness: blurred the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: find the color basins in the image and wipe them without altering the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells, and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value."</seg>
<seg id="623">"some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button fastening."</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation. you can find the tools in the menu Transforming Turning or Transforming Spider."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"change the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approach pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to inflate."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintaining aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose. enlarge Every single image for photo can be saved as text file, and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button fastening."</seg>
<seg id="639">The original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">"the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"if you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut out. this way you will get a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting. you can create a new rectangle by simply using the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog, remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool Move to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and width is always assigned to width."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you are centimeter, inch or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the combination aid enable you to mask aligns so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity.</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden middle: the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty. "</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will give you good results for your photos. compared to the third elbow the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition results in a symmetric visual flow along the way of the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles."</seg>
<seg id="657">"its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no uniform triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. the result is a very attractive composition which you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button Color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are set in degrees. with the button Preferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transforming trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the anti-aliasing option gives the picture a bit after rotation. however, please note the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: indicates the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes a little blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments make a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adapted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformative trimming from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the shifting tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image is distorted into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transforming scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using horizontal and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angles are displayed to zero. a preview of the Effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have carried out the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two zations produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after the shearing, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transformative slicing from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiling. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="684">"because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on your system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below."</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to choose the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>

<seg id="860">"if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use it, you should not select the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing in a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>

<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>

<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch on Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>

<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the table sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"for example, if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun shot. for this purpose, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch where each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have it)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is its presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones to the percussions channel. see the included keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, all events will be ignored in the file name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied with the value n, this is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal commas are available."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which gets a pitch-naming event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the channel view is a window with a whole number of claviaturen (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos, you see which sounds are being played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not flash green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played notes. view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can be played on two different devices with very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone to use kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language you like. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; Repository if someone has done that for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part is left to you, the second we will handle here."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than" "Medium" "(default setting)."</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example you can now see in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062">"the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than" "Medium" "(default setting)."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the shaft depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">"whitespace influence nothing, but be sure & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus, resource files."</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file used to create context sensitive help. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separator resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. there is an email-sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading you are asked for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resource dialog, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripting tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, investigate & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand this and to draw full benefits from & quantaplus, you have to familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local, and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus. it stores all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which can then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use that user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the carton guides with information and the toolbars. please consult, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document matching entries, e.g. reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS orders to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editing pane will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tag under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor."</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further development of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the icon that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and strip them. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building views."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that drives & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu shown."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"a further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all possibilities open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking on the right mouse button, other functions are available, such as launching, editing, or sending e-mail."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears among the other tree-views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can be changed. the system-oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can create pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"by default, & quantaplus; two cartons at the bottom of the window, which can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window."</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus, send the toolbar as a compressed tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure and load them in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus. to do this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & knu3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text fast, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & knu3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>

<seg id="2300">"what is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd need to create two corresponding files, upload them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, insert and compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can repair it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name and if it contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have a server running level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. furthermore, I could also have a user -runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts between runleveln or alter the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly rebooting. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; available for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just end without notice if their configuration files are not present or set up correctly."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that it can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you will need to save them. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or record in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user / group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space constraints (quota) for users, a card card is created where you can make individual settings. other card cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card password management appears, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd, are installed like in BSD."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card list only appears if there is limited space limitation for at least one integrated file system (Quota) and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the limited space restrictions are in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the array file system with restricted space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card group informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the field Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the User or group or click the Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group will be analogous."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO-System Manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, remove the time until booting the standard operating system, remove, remove, modify, change operating systems, remove, modify, and more."</seg>
