&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is enormous .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he was playing Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The P@@ eli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who wanted to occupy the su@@ ici@@ dal conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges , who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; I was , as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only reinforced my admir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very nice letter of love about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never keeps behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party .
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tru@@ mp &apos;s world@@ view did not coinci@@ de with the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; tru@@ mp intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp launched his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Pres@@ i@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; order people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( &quot; &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; white in all@@ usion to the Wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like s@@ ling@@ ering whi@@ pl@@ ash ) , as the great Van Jones named , has just killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election of Donald Tru@@ mps , however , there is a huge part of the white America promise and says : hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Turkey &apos;s country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; that the music played in both places , not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with its musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with gle@@ aming eyes and playing in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er started to turn parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all produced from the garbage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
at first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
&quot; this changed when Fa@@ vio had seen something , which he had never seen before : a violin made of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year .
&quot; those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ publication takes place within the scope of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the liber@@ ian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to purchase one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal Fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , who then expelled the Premier from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . that &apos;s why illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; the deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the worm emp@@ ires , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , with satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . thus , suspi@@ cious driving routes can also be discovered - such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such examinations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant firm committed to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue , which are losing the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen that enter East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts the region for commercial fishing from all over the world . among them also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; among other things actions are like sailing under false flag , fake license documents , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You cannot run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole , F@@ ISH @-@ i tries to close . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean conservation organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that just makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources to investigate . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts have a similar project , where a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that had been f@@ ished without a license earlier , and had little consequences , now know they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing revenues , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board smu@@ ggle networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under a false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still inv@@ aded in prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a particular , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot; &quot;
the movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s office .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a military action , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the rep@@ atri@@ ation of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centre @-@ north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the office of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the position of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , member of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a gra@@ cious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was regarded as the only way to regain its institutional structures and to include a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces to support the National Assembly after the elections of 2015 , should continue to continue blocking the referendum on November 3 . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter amongst others as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday country @-@ wide civil strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration within the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The Rec@@ re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among others an overwhelming involvement of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds , &quot; Will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ ans . &quot;
it is enough without sh@@ it .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located north @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have !
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic depic@@ ts the level of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for a minist@@ erial post - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of innum@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your office life !
on the road !
&quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from their point of view , had little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather have dealt with critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on August 24 , 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ yer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was indic@@ ted for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ o &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the enorm@@ ity of the atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made you friends with one from the ERP . &quot;
pass only that they will not lead you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me that I would become secret .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok , because my father had educated me . &quot;
&quot; at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tortured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
all of that was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et , wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a huge cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I looked in and saw a lying on which people were tortured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the end of a cable to it . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; they rarely tie a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it out with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian that was also accused of the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down@@ wards - all were tied at hands and feet .
close to the entrance cau@@ tioned people quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors reviews , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was sentenced to death by the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war of war &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that you take away from an enemy you fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied : &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded anger , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
for this we need no one else !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to tell .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel regret . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have children first , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship , but what the bodies had to disappear ? &quot;
why do children kid@@ nap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl to her home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easier to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their bodies had to disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mort@@ al rem@@ nants ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a person .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course there is always something left .
I saw how you killed people !
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to display my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you say something to me ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he just said &quot; &quot; Well , tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I issued the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced in 28 cases life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were sp@@ outs .
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ stly : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including ex @-@ military officers , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the judgment seat is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was , so that there could be a memorial , which is now headed by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful driving &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long its driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ erable translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word has been translated as &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly , but also with mali@@ ci@@ ously back @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible driver . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n published in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely pity that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News got a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers that are involved in accidents throughout the country , however , are quite a reason to worry . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ter , named in particular , brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older mot@@ orists : &quot;
the article on Yahoo for translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; however , some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations into the company internally . then , the Japanese associate , whose knowledge of English as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , but by large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Kyoto City will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; website of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
other online transm@@ it@@ ters were also taking photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as that were organized by opposition groups that opposed the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and entrusted the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was attached , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially during periods of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as &quot; calling for violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it will continue to be cheaper than to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ Sin@@ fil@@ et later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was not accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds incorrect or refuses the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sli@@ ders into the same page !
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that which has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . when Cri@@ adi@@ ta calls in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for the countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up . &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls , who were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ p@@ ples the cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family that their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something of themselves &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who receives the girl with her and justi@@ fies his exploitation with faith , justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ised that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela have made the deep into the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; mour@@ ned Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ ad .
&quot; if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before the court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as man@@ power , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to make money .
they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ ad .
&quot; in her employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
she had to share the time so that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the master than food out of the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings the owner of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial articles such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to not believe in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but not convers@@ ing with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened to while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they believe that I would have &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; again there . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , explained them . &quot;
&quot; however , she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that almost never talked about is mo@@ bbing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to home . I had no circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
&quot; starting on Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot;
then the ph@@ asing @-@ in of the display switched on again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was complete .

bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; Regulation on the use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is adopted by parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up which is responsible for granting citizens a permit to grant social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adop@@ ting the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a financial penalty . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application running and used via the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed that the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities are not able to register their registration in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media enterprises .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , deputy commission@@ er and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who are applying for approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court . &quot;
this is technically not realistic at all - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose minds the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leopard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and thri@@ ving of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian Leopard in the wild wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to show a different side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the three @-@ fold disaster in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a few pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was still experiencing a nuclear accident , already on its own alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper includes the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned replacement houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate finished 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , they were still trying to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ated accommodation arrangements ( as part of the present day , to cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare houses . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of those evacu@@ ated after the disaster in accommodation shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by disaster , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident suffered large @-@ scale involvement in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear waste , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level , as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers find it difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
in her introduction to the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed say that still not enough in the event of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people returning to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees still have to compete in homes , older than 50 years old . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that it connects more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love of music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer fought against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studying social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred it into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the conclusion of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers hurry to hurry . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also reflected in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father , only to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police attacks on the police
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
&quot; police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rub@@ bers and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to renoun@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers all over the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ oured a cover story with a bus set in fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic ground to report more about a broken window than over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
you must also acknowledge this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ isation in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular village Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after the harvest , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene recalls closely to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not held . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are not yet new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality looked at even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; Agri@@ cultural perspectives &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate about $ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , there was a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first school year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which would differ only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench was er@@ ased out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the plants in the congregations in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly through grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather said , when they began to mut@@ ate it , they also ceased to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they have been replaced .
&quot; without a prospect of a future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that you told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes back 65 years in retirement , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter@@ ly bitter . &quot;

first Nations teenagers use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo courtesy of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing in the fact that the young participants in conversations include topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the theme of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a drop in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; at the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I continue trying to go on Earth my days
that is the day you will take our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so , they can grow and move forward as our youth &quot;
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the comments section readers and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ar ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( all @-@ in @-@ part , as well as those of us ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance to the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; Plastic Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the To@@ o district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend has turned them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver mat@@ omes published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic dishes decorated cell phone bands as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ cu@@ dd@@ les fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essenti@@ als will become more and more complex .
&quot; in this case , an emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
&quot; some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or Lach@@ s@@ che@@ ated is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more bizarre plastic dishes you can watch out at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to h@@ ash@@ tag # , all @-@ around @-@ the @-@ place features around the top of the page . &quot;
&quot; if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ les and gh@@ o@@ sts regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every corp@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project in such a way :
organised crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore whole communities need to travel a lot of kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victim
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear@@ ful life changes &quot; ) tells exactly those stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews only one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked to go and search for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known illness and sensation@@ alism for a few years now .
&quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the titles with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the non@@ violence of people is unbelievable for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; bot@@ her@@ ed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats for month , until it destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are apart from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez &quot; &quot; : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw just a few blocks from his home , the bloody corp@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , acting as violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor included 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to describe the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tortured the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages to which it links contain pictures depicting violence .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ our or to expose a fake .
&quot; but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to detect trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of homes wrapped up including a cinema close by , which was full of people who viewed the World Cup . &quot;
houses bre@@ wed and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of char@@ red bodies , which are lined up on the ground while people look at them . &quot;
but here history does not come to an end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am fighters attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically of atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were lying in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a man to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been cut down , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ ten@@ ders ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; a step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely affect the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations described those who could flee , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein , and monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news agencies , called AF@@ P as their source , wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein Sein to this statement , but had not associated with it the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling reach back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can cross boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images of 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they originate from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages including English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have set examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which have been inter@@ connected in some cases ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; the orange @-@ coloured countries point to pages or servers , which are still available on the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or false statements . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples , which are available according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is not Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein has admitted that monks and politicians have been involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image remains in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who were killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital news page , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , the picture of the DR Congo th@@ war@@ ted and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was weather@@ ed for the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to false announcement . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image was included in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gra@@ u ) also instruc@@ t Tin@@ Eye but are not fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image finally bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence relating to the assass@@ inations of Christians through Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second frame uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dissem@@ ination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images attract readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which actually can also be replaced by context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. uns@@ ett@@ able ) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or even impossible to translate .
&quot; such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist@@ s stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected all the time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - pay attention to your parents in recognition of how you have tried yourself in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med yourself in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ ens@@ ed other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show more of these &quot; uns@@ ur@@ passed &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of Sri Lanka &apos; disaster centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and just hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge waves . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 secure places of stay . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed for the transport of emergency deliveries for the occup@@ ants included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for anyone who wants to don@@ ate dry food and vital supplies for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ ency Center is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up of assistance and donations . these were then forwarded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring inhabitants in need of safety and contribute to help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
&quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she confi@@ det@@ h to me her children , and she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we sc@@ are rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f high , bound by an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they have had to m@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective conception , that as soon as Muslims do not fit into it , they will be Muslim . &quot;
to be eliminated
I am not alone with that alone .
&quot; this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures come in mind when you think of him ?
love for you ?
peace ? peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this dele@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images also rise further .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narr@@ atives over@@ shad@@ owing the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries over the last three decades , while the US is not even able to choose its first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ ration fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead to movements for change .
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has taken our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ ende@@ mic attacks and attacks .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ American Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

usage is approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan re@@ considered herself the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or applying my hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with - &quot; &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I joke , we don &apos;t carry all pick@@ pockets with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing tape of a well lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have been manipul@@ ated by our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger who tears the scar@@ f of a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the usual ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses to protect the Koran and to be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see , and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

usage is approved .
belonging to my grandmother &apos;s mother@@ hood is the image of my grandmother with her sisters ; how to win a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the image of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ Saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they had told me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that - over centuries - has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company has established with the name of Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
usage is approved .
&quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept about his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have colon@@ ized all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was thrown over a Muslim country over a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over each continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy domin@@ ates the United States and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history four times more is reported as a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing bi@@ dity &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its limits vis @-@ à @-@ vis people from just the countries it bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
these are the wars we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically in@@ appropriate image and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we stand back for decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous image prints that we ste@@ er in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; S@@ app@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this gives me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing we are in .
and this moment has consequences which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that grew expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet existed ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today an un@@ resolved Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militarism . &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are being fought and people through the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was self @-@ scientific of Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously doing the &quot; others &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I have been bombar@@ ded in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , as he already bombs broken countries and &quot; &quot; other made &quot; &quot; people , he goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect to someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure rooms , where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often linked to &quot; understanding , &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience li@@ stens to it . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as the language no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the f@@ uss of the rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after explaining the importance of his ability , John Ny@@ am@@ us ara is asked : &quot; how to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were alert ...
they were very with me !
&quot; to date , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico requires re@@ establishing public debt from the US
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 2017 ; the march started at the Dominican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went through to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the Com@@ en@@ ical Church Assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the ren@@ dition of debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos claim that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt will be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which operates in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not fall down with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state @-@ pool integrated territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration wore the name &quot; Nacht@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up at times of extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for Syrian government since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police Bass@@ el &quot; &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 they had been contacted by persons who themselves presented themselves as In@@ sider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown , however . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry For@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently managing director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ tille &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the crossroads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it to eradic@@ ate this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and preservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in custody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and write English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ s@@ book that she wrote in 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the haz@@ ards doesn &apos;t matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the rush of the prison
and I sing in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ;
to bring back all the moments
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ tille &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release again on previous post
&quot; Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption attack , with which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this was Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants because of dis@@ em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800@@ ,000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public money at the airports of Mozambique , the Council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately demanded his re @-@ election to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which issued the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not pursue disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
&quot; the company , however , was silent and did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradictory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been lowered . &quot;
&quot; he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is fond of paying for his silence .
resist !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself on the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself had become tired of this man who was pre@@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the pris@@ ons of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only as the first independent president to be remembered , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he affir@@ med that &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he does not change tactics but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was free . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; reverse &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ likes to be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese as well as &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post by one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it all extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the following words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all sending hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not pers@@ ist for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards &quot; &quot; was not consistent . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author informed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hate within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate language , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post states &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critici@@ zed for its failure , the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot;
&quot; but instead of cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have looked better in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice , so that the age @-@ right age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this has happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; , &quot; each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , trying to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition made tension in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which reads Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it .
&quot; once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the social media users were thrilled , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who had a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age @-@ proof age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independently of the religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 depu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all the depu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law .
&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the chil@@ dr@@ ens are no longer permitted by law . &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # god@@ parents .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our depu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best @-@ known Hind@@ u organization . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to release his promise now . &quot;
&quot; while At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said that it is perfectly legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most of the social media users wanted the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; rather than talking about the problem that the state , our daughters , would like to say that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men , which are in the advantage of them , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage in different stages is legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they say . &quot;
hack@@ ers control the office of the prosec@@ utor in front of the national protests on the Russian National Day
screen printing of the message posted on Sunday early on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district .
&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day , the website of the prosec@@ utor of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was hack@@ ed . hack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; Sta@@ y at home . &quot;

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page - but in the cache it remained intact .

&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia site was presented on January 18 , 2012 , opposite to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are sub@@ merged . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer @-@ computer connections ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is call@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
&quot; after hearing the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to cover sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ ages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;

&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colours .
the motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river D@@ am is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he arose from face to face with tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger cannot distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ g appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took him to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ zer and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , it avo@@ ids women with the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and expelled from her family and village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name . &quot;
&quot; although tradition does not name their wives by name , it is also common among men . however , they have far fewer grants to fear if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city &apos;s main topic . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the exploitation of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working with the help of their video camera on the coverage of practices such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club . &quot;
she tells us how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of the change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands on their behalf . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
&quot; to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands no lou@@ dly is a custom , which they all have to be du@@ tiful and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video came to an end .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she had the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never allowed to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only sitting in front of him , another decided to let loose all the frustr@@ ated frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; still in adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation led to violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , showing the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped to carry it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry , who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ted spa , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes , the mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will make it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things come slowly : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , still do it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members there . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are in the same boat . &quot;
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was part of the &quot; &quot; World of World &quot; &quot; ( Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 , noticed 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here have become quite quickly aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese Kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese secondary schools . &quot;
the kite of Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , they of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; the Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
&quot; right today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market technology , like this R@@ amen shop ( amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could this be for one day ?
&quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
this is how the day is going on .
&quot; so , we hope you are here ! &quot;

tall @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that large @-@ headed men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping individuals for the organ trade , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , al@@ armed the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they said that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , the BBC , declared the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a strong man of gold could bring gold or wealth . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of sub@@ missions for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight against this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Muslim police warned about the latest kill@@ ings of three men @-@ headed men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the men @-@ headed men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of long @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that faith existed , according to which the victims were in the head power , generating wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty , to which Mozambique is facing : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE , GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed a country where people would be ashamed to have sex against good notes , a nation in which men would be ashamed to have sex against good notes , a country in which men would be ashamed to get their bread , a country in which men would aim to get lost wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humour . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique , and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald heads : &quot;
Muslim authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ inations of people who have been killed .

&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to get calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has combined some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man declined to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . Norway signed an agreement in June to resume salmon exports to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the news had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US embassy asked for an angry response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany - Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had big concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged China to provide li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um goes on telling :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to free them for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan as well as Taiwan
&quot; the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u , and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... nobody questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; reverse the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of this , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the distorted logic as it fits better to its power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he tar@@ ried the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing An@@ on on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the full board of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the co @-@ ordin@@ ance .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , &quot; &quot; Be not a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , expecting me - either I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes it is correct and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ closes the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian Spe@@ aker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally country and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the cabinet &apos;s cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their city but their country ? &quot;
who does our Prime Minister have to pay back ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever told Singapore that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; in my clari@@ fication the standard answer usually follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
they all love Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
gender marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , for example , if you would switch me to Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; firstly : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ook@@ y - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being inno@@ cu@@ ous means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to only take care of our own affairs .
what external standing as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada really sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video that is famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ odi@@ ls the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the ongoing military su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 list@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which are referring to some of the political issues that Thailand has persi@@ sted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives absolute decision making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; Adju@@ st@@ ment Change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as critics of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ fe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the law of war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs featured members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chi@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ electric basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after it had hardly increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s that are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s , which still have one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where clothes are dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ et@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ use ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Asia forever , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
it tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .

it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .

a group of children now tracks the ball rolling .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ ck .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outdoors on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication which they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m , exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ chin ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ ck .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston where she can find her husband and her three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans talk to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answered , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to sal@@ ute her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ educ@@ ator , offered him their roof . &quot;
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les the travelers consult their phones quietly .
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of those who went away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair care , she made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sor@@ row@@ fully while she imag@@ ines her briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , as well as &quot;
&quot; the people of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi got a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities tried to use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police notice that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control your home network . &quot;
this app with the filtering for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focuses on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme en@@ grav@@ ings and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
photos from a check@@ point where police officers checked the inhabitants random@@ ly to check whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .

&quot; a recent report from Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June , the authorities published a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile devices , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ qui &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both inside and outside . &quot;
&quot; one , which makes all the glory of their name . &quot;
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer , the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of the Un@@ holy . you realize that you have been trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security guard formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all quarters sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; several times from my house roof . &quot;
I listened to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment , you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care about you in the slightest . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you &apos; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
and you really mo@@ urn what to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I replied , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought you had forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father in the same way . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
afterwards through the yard and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I form@@ ulate all the details before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably have allocated a bigger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and can immediately put me on without waiting for permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I attacked an old @-@ tried method of communication : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ level was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ year @-@ ling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a distinguished middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total darkness , there are no distinctive fac@@ ul@@ ties to me , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my voice ?
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured in the fruit in my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of corruption until I saw the yellow light that the horror in person presented to us : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was venti@@ l@@ ated : to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they played in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - and they betra@@ yed their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye of view of their world view . &quot;
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
&quot; I cared for the listening room and met Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; despite the facial expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to it , to be punished , even though I did nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not yet enough , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector or if it belonged to normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the great invention of a giant cable , from their point of view . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he &apos;s next to an electrically charged stick . &quot;
&quot; power flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , lying on the floor , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be worried . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he lo@@ oses to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stained lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ e ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian whis@@ per of the second generation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while in water the Nes@@ café is poured into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during that time , it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ its of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if you take a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in the public during Ram@@ adan , in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jordan &apos;s Ministry of Interior has announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MPs and former press spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled due to the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old @-@ time legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian nation as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which continues to be elected &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender norms by turning his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ led unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who should trust them . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of victims of domestic violence or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ famili@@ al violence can &quot; &quot; in@@ definitely be held in prison &quot; &quot; and for their release is often a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family necessary that the woman has nothing to do . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes that have long been considered a t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , and cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been inver@@ ted to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the nucleus can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality were cens@@ ored by LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but stre@@ amed only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ v , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks , if Abu Nu@@ v , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not believe it ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service noted several former government depu@@ ties and members of the Association of Te@@ ach@@ ers , with the reason they had critical comments in social media about the problems rooted in the country rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan did not stop M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will bring about genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist@@ s resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one thought that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the for@@ lor@@ ries , drums and dancing have come from a time in which armies mar@@ ched from the west of Japan to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the disciples to their knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to s@@ nat@@ ch some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 metre high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region could not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to trade young people to trade their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain training in hair@@ dres@@ ser art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of its successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built up this educational community . &quot;

the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel em@@ power@@ ing to counter@@ act affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga , from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ erri@@ lla movement ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians should join together and help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an Inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this declared that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot;
he continued to talk about sharing his love with people this year that needed the most urgent response .
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC turned up as they had previously done to counter the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ illo &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot; &quot; then suddenly tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
&quot; at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process . &quot;
&quot; the aim of this order is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give a smile and hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians have been prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ arming .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without arms . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
activists witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs like a dam@@ o@@ clas@@ p on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports published , which dealt with the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens of the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she went to the USA in the end . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos from my documents were made by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was doing some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you junk ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and began to scre@@ am .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
&quot; OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid , in the men or the women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running above without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was only bad things , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car stood under the window with a dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; I left the country with her help , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought her without registering me , without identification , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
came to and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered for a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re feeling safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about sex equ@@ ation , this is a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian items in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look at how the person looks at which they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told us that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock out a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood grati@@ fication . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still trapped in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there are not so many . &quot;
&quot; if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to judge Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are captured there in order to be able to present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but deliberately di@@ pped to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 , I was already well known in Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but finally thrown us back into the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked up ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed me with just one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ire not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes in front of you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
&quot; he who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came home , I could feel the situation in the Republic wor@@ sen@@ ed steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ urs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t pay a p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I cli@@ pped off the type of influ@@ x .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; thus nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ er who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ ents to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different attitudes of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 rec@@ alled the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he lit himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im have been hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe job . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab ancest@@ or population living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power and in 1925 assumed great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable land areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Iranian regime systematically refuses Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs to work in the local oil , gas , and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t water from the Arabic areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi youth now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions do not pre@@ tend to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes . &quot;
&quot; in view of the circumstances given by the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists hit the alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be female in general . &quot;
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I speak on skin color , racism , black c@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t associate myself as a black woman who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ n compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a bad and margin@@ alized being in historical regard . &quot;
I refuse to join group groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and sex , because some of them will continue to honour the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different sources a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : recall ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we re@@ conquer ourselves ) , we can also create spaces in which they can be fully assured and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of Kurdist@@ an in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is based on poorly attended sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their way . &quot;

&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not find anything useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the prosecution authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ ps and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ visible mal@@ treatment and a legal system that does not include any of Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation blows and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ gy@@ z , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the available figures are al@@ arming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads of domestic violence in the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this will come to any woman who will not do this , &quot; she explained to the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder is not an independent crime in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to her estimates , a woman died in Paraguay every ten days because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she gave up . this should always be regre@@ t@@ table . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years , she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most vulnerable : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they can be deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated it . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with mental mal@@ treatment .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victori@@ as ads to the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she took a trial against her former partner who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # Prince ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees that Fem@@ izi@@ d is to explain and to punish offen@@ sively as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text was modified in a number of points to also win MEPs for the law that are generally forbidden to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ aw , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs that the victims of violence must bear at present themselves if they just want to reimbur@@ se and receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get out of action . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until ill treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ intervene .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman launched a year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information and is to be read on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he has a one @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were arrested and brought to trial , but later returned free . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had set off his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sultan is marked by the insi@@ di@@ ous efforts of the security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , restric@@ ting and det@@ ecting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict and block peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS celebrated the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper was prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences , and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were convic@@ ted of &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amounting to 3000 om@@ ani@@ ans in each case ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dissem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit was set at the amount of 5,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronoun@@ cement of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was acqu@@ itted on 26 December 2016 in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the prison prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he has served his one @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence .
&quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to let Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Korean government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order , with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three additional months and with which the Minister presented another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ equip the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Korean authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Korean authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
&quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : firstly there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have much more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , the research carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the director of central laboratory on the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself searched for the HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the Sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I have just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
GV : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver , instead of being a man himself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines only make articles accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com &apos;s website , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
&quot; the patents do not only apply to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still cultiv@@ ates let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der around which I must d@@ ull .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , nobody can breed a new type of salad because all features are already patented . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement growing ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS ate and ate red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station . &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately break out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to it , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , as it is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available freely , as opposed to patented seeds and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited , shr@@ inks . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked with car@@ rots and their availability in her PhD thesis . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that large @-@ scale grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ able due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is another bree@@ der , because &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not in@@ hibit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees this differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to breed into plants , adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources .
&quot; in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of being patented : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ eppe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i member of the Executive Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are required mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is very opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they create most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also convinced that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is the centre with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to get to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , one explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend to crop seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source &apos; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which scheduled start @-@ up next year should be the official launch . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to exchange and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particular attention to where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people aware that even more is behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities are blocking content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 5th August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above them . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information persi@@ sts in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should actually defend the law to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been so important . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network , due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web sites for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissem@@ ination of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now , the blog he used to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship apparatus of the Egyptian government was even the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this meant for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if blocking the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege ; A arrest , a attempted murder , a charge of the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ sts go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te also documented the locking of vendors , which enabled Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
such a practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; in addition , the situation is wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian Army used in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air coffee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the force of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published on August 16 , the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio , will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inter@@ nal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper continues to write :
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which is only shooting and then asking questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm any more than it uses ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; in Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; the Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ als per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for many years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this has actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under attack following several reports on ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux borrow@@ ed from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ discern@@ ing point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; mistaken spheres . &quot; &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
&quot; a week ago , the police cl@@ apped up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died due to shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : to learn more bes@@ et Syrians to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a particularly strongly affects the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become indispensable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics educ@@ ate the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and facilit@@ ated its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , you can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of mushrooms coming from the regions &quot; before examining their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tank . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months they have distributed fung@@ i throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on October 21 in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October .
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European For@@ estry Monitoring System , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil defence was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federal Government of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ ranging proposal on the reform form , which the government introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; says Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to the fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October when people searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative which provided the population with information : it took advantage of its own civilian protection data using the application fo@@ cast@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website had more than half a million requests . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :
it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .

the way from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

&quot; in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out among the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hatred came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was found again in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his small salary , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mortar , heavier than he himself , to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked as well . &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy people . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high incidence rati@@ os . however , it is true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception center if they officially submit an application for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ bo@@ unded li@@ fes@@ pan helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of the companies operated by Afgh@@ ans , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants were created . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the dining menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retailers and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul factory where people can learn about packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity prevail . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen &apos;s report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws enable social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

the Egyptian parliament checks a bill which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government agency .
&quot; users would have to register to use the social networks , within six months of successful law bombar@@ d@@ ment on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and their ID number . &quot;
&quot; if you miss this step , you may be sentenced to six months of prison sentence or the final payment of a sentence . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently present to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal to introduce stric@@ ter pen@@ alties for the president &apos;s insul@@ t or high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . however , under the legislative proposal , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts from Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is to be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had led to the military coup of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 demonstr@@ ators who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his hearing was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including weapons of weapons , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was speaking the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists to stop res@@ ett@@ led documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a transparent plan of action . according to the plan , the president of the Republic , according to the plan , was specifically supported by a controversial bill of legislation that would grant business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused of corruption @-@ accused official am@@ nesty , provided they all return illeg@@ ally received mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document , published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code which journalists have granted the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared at the District Court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity card ?
&quot; according to new regulations by the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before writing or sharing news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stated in the rules that registration will be required with the full real name . &quot;
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
can we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat decided to register as the &quot; organizer of the dissem@@ ination of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law dated 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services , which provides the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to send user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ bl@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site had been blocked because it became &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to support a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocking the website . it is , alongside others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs , de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . responses and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
