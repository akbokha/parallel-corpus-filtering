<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he was playing Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the suicidal conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges, who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man," I was, as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only reinforced my admiration."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very nice letter of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never keeps behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trump's worldview did not coincide with the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"trump intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump launched his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"order people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(" "white against all other ethnicities" "; white in allusion to the Whites and Whiplash, which means so much like slingering whiplash), as the great Van Jones named, has just killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America promise and says: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Turkey's country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca have in common with the children of the Paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"that the music played in both places, not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with its musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and playing with gleaming eyes and playing in the chest you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler started to turn parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all produced from the garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed when Favio had seen something, which he had never seen before: a violin made of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place within the scope of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the liberian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to purchase one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do," recalls Benedict Kiilu, an employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal Fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries, who then expelled the Premier from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. that's why illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the worm empires, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, with satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. thus, suspicious driving routes can also be discovered - such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such examinations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant firm committed to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million in lost revenue, which are losing the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen that enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region for commercial fishing from all over the world. among them also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things actions are like sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system, "" says Long. "" in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You cannot run my port'. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" Come to me. "" and exactly this legal loophole, FISH-i tries to close. "</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to track the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean conservation organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each trackable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that just makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources to investigate."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable trusts have a similar project, where a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that had been fished without a license earlier, and had little consequences, now know they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing revenues, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found on board smuggle networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under a false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still invaded in prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "said Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a particular, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's office.</seg>

<seg id="157">"after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a military action, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the repatriation of Venezuela), both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the land area of Barinas, in the Andes-regions Mérida and Táchira, in the centre-north of the federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the office of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the position of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, member of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a gracious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was regarded as the only way to regain its institutional structures and to include a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces to support the National Assembly after the elections of 2015, should continue to continue blocking the referendum on November 3."</seg>

<seg id="201">"in the trial, which ended on August 24, 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I thought it was fine."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>

<seg id="229">'cause the prisoners are tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of that was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet, wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a huge clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I looked in and saw a lying on which people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the end of a cable to it. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely tie a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it out with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian that was also accused of the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying with the face downwards - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Close to the entrance cautioned people quietly on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said," "Why do you look so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"(according to the survivors reviews, Jorge Romero, who was also accused of the La Perla Ribera process, was sentenced to death by the students of Raúl Mateo Molina)."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way where the abductions came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look at the map, you will see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they were to be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war of war'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at age I had no idea what the "war spoils" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, was able to participate in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied:" "and you who steal cars on the street?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded anger, struck me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"when you go so far, I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">For this we need no one else!</seg>
<seg id="284">That's how my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"as I said in the process, I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pullover made of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me on the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to tell.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel regret."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. if you have children first, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you were executing people during the dictatorship, but what the bodies had to disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl to her home, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easier to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but what their bodies had to disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that one can do to a person.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was introduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." you'll never find anything, "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But of course there is always something left.</seg>
<seg id="307">I saw how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought to display my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the atrocities that I had to experience because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked me what the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they supposedly defended, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you say something to me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I saw how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he just said" "Well, tell me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">This is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I issued the first advertisement.</seg>

<seg id="348">"on a sign, the Japanese word has been translated as" "older drivers", "wrongly, but also with maliciously back-thought & # 8212; as" terrible driver. ""</seg>

<seg id="351">"the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>

<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>

<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "Holmes said."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the designation" "dangerous drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate term" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto police apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely pity that elderly people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation)," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News got a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awfully "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers that are involved in accidents throughout the country, however, are quite a reason to worry."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"however, some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations into the company internally. then, the Japanese associate, whose knowledge of English as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic sentences, which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, but by large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, Kyoto City will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="419">"shortly before her graduation at the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"that which has become something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. when Criadita calls in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes her underage son or her minor daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for the countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas, especially young girls, who were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that cripples the criadita is generally silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family that their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" make something of themselves "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family, who receives the girl with her and justifies his exploitation with faith, justifies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they even never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret in paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent blows."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasised that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela have made the deep into the Paraguayan society rooted practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no other Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>

<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criad.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asuncion as Criad.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in her employer's house, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the master than food out of the fridge, "she remembers."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"on some evenings the owner of Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial articles such as" "Sendero" "or" "El Pueblo". ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to not believe in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">"he thought she was intelligent, but not conversing with her." the host had found someone who listened to while talking about politics, "she says."</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't allow me to visit my family because they believe that I would have" "bad habits" "again there."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft legislation on "Regulation on the use and usage of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is adopted by parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would be set up which is responsible for granting citizens a permit to grant social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of adopting the law, users would have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a financial penalty."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application running and used via the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed that the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities are not able to register their registration in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, deputy commissioner and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on the national level around Facebook. because of them, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" leading research scientist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who are applying for approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic at all - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose minds the control is maximized and ensuring that no deviating narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and thriving of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian Leopard in the wild wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of their country, which is not only of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the three-fold disaster in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a few prefectures in Japan northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate were forcibly evacuated, as the tsunami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the prefecture Fukushima was still experiencing a nuclear accident, already on its own alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned replacement houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate finished 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, they were still trying to relocate evacuated accommodation arrangements (as part of the present day, to casetsu juutaku) into final spare houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold disaster, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such cases."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 per cent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of those evacuated after the disaster in accommodation shelters were resettled into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by disaster, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures, the tsunami and the nuclear accident suffered large-scale involvement in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear waste, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima lie in the" "nuclear barrier zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level, as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers find it difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed say that still not enough in the event of catastrophes prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people returning to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuees still have to compete in homes, older than 50 years old. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the popular village Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the harvest, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the smells of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>

<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period, because they were received."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene recalls closely to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not held."</seg>

<seg id="638">"in 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but bad harvests are not yet new."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality looked at even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" "Agricultural perspectives" "by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), raw sugar exports would generate about $85 million for the country."</seg>

<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing in the fact that the young participants in conversations include topics such as" cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes in mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the theme of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a drop in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"at the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I continue trying to go on Earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance to the shokuhin sanpuru (" "Plastic Models of the Courts" ") of each dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Too district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend has turned them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver matomes published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="728">The new boom in essentials will become more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an emperor-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case ikura or Lachscheated is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missiles and ghosts regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "to live with drug trafficking" "), telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime lets us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore whole communities need to travel a lot of kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victim</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fearful life changes") tells exactly those stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews only one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked to go and search for graves, according to the people we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta said: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who fear fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensationalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the titles with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroism" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the nonviolence of people is unbelievable for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "bothered". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to persuade themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was pillaged with threats for month, until it destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are apart from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez" ": a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier, when he saw just a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, acting as violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor included 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to describe the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to detect tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" false description "or" false context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, the dozens of homes wrapped up including a cinema close by, which was full of people who viewed the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses brewed and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to infinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria." "from Imgur-users Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">"it shows rows of charred bodies, which are lined up on the ground while people look at them."</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram fighters attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were lying in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one remained behind to count corpses," "said a man to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been cut down, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unresolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mistenders; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"a step further, personal comments such as this example falsely affect the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning message, published by the United Nations described those who could flee, rape and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page that falsely claimed President Myanmar's Thein Sein, and monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information."</seg>

<seg id="921">"after a message that was allegedly written by a" "Father Juan Carlos Martos" "about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and explained it to false announcement."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the message in which the image was included in the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretiner Missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence relating to the assassinations of Christians through Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second frame uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern that violent images attract readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which actually can also be replaced by context or completely abusive manner."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unsettable) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or even impossible to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">"such words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific."</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resists stubbornly to any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected all the time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird has decided to concentrate on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "vakasteglok" "- pay attention to your parents in recognition of how you have tried yourself in your younger years."</seg>
<seg id="953">"and words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi - The comfort or laziness you feel after having warmed yourself in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they defensed other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page, and show more of these" unsurpassed "words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are."</seg>

<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>

<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure rooms, where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often linked to" understanding, "these events instead" "listen to" "to appreciate, feel, touch."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers introduce their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 2017; the march started at the Dominican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went through to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was called by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination of debt) and the Comenical Church Assembly of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the rendition of debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos claim that the politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debt will be held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which operates in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not fall down with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the state-pool integrated territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"hence the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed from the outside will be jeopardized without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available royalty-free contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own fates, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up at times of extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in prison for Syrian government since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police Bassel" "had taken part in Adra as a" "strictly secret" "command of the military tribunal in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 they had been contacted by persons who themselves presented themselves as Insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"his whereabouts and condition remain unknown, however."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Forrew, a designer, technologist and currently managing director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastille's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it to eradicate this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and preservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read and write English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a prosbook that she wrote in 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption attack, with which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this was Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants because of disembezzlement of 54 million Metikal (about 800,000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public money at the airports of Mozambique, the Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately demanded his re-election to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which issued the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not pursue disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, was silent and did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "contradictory" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been lowered."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is fond of paying for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resist!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has so massively insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served itself on the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself had become tired of this man who was precharged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeút is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prisons of Samora Machel, not only as the first independent president to be remembered, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator."</seg>

<seg id="1279">"Samora said," "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he does not change tactics but he does not turn away from his ambitions."</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "reverse" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'likes to be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese as well as' Kalar htaing ', which contains the same letters as well as other words like' Kalar pae ',' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post by one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "healing" "+ the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it all extinguishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the following words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all sending hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not persist for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to share content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook Community Standards" "was not consistent."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author informed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hate within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" chair "or" peas curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate language, but nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticized for its failure, the rampant hate speech on its Burmese pages."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of censoring the word" Kalar, "it would have looked better in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1347">"the statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were already married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 were 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, trying to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to tell the critics of the children's marriage, they should, to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition made tension in this really uncomplicated thing, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook which reads Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once it has been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"the majority of the social media users were thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who had a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for over a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third-largest VPN-prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users don't fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most well-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, several mirror sites (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are submerged."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), as the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer-computer connections), which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is callable despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after hearing the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to cover snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia a.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a Mirrorseite from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrorages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river Dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he arose from face to face with tigers:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot disturb from the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Bug appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at him and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took him to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the tourist accommodations."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyzer and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, it avoids women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state Odisha by a false court and expelled from her family and village community after she had addressed a married relative with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"although tradition does not name their wives by name, it is also common among men. however, they have far fewer grants to fear if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city's main topic."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and campaigning for the exploitation of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years Rohini Paist has been working with the help of their video camera on the coverage of practices such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in its discussion round, acted by women who did not name their husbands on their behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands no loudly is a custom, which they all have to be dutiful and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" "Patriarchate" "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which she had the name of her husbands on her lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only sitting in front of him, another decided to let loose all the frustrated frustrations against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stared she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation led to violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, showing the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped to carry it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry, who could hear what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted a salted spa, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, the morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will make it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things come slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, still do it, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from unlimited groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "messages of those who experience themselves", "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1627">"this story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press."</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(state endangerment), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an" "internal matter" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China continues to get calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has combined some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman declined to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. Norway signed an agreement in June to resume salmon exports to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as stated in a statement on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all the limitations of Mr. Lius's wife and family members."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the US embassy asked for an angry response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China urged China to provide liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Lius attorney told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum goes on telling:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to free them for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>

<seg id="1671">"although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it."</seg>

<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very worried in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I personally felt very moved and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "reverse the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of this, he seemed invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities that are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic as it fits better to its power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried the corresponding questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing Anon on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the full board of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the co-ordinance.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore is rather a" city "than a country," "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said," "Be not a country," "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, expecting me - either I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes it is correct and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discloses the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmugam" "good faith" "committed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian Speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the cabinet's cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their city but their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister have to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever told Singapore that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, "etc. but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently its editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">"their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with which rumors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another facet is to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"in my clarification the standard answer usually follows:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, Nature. "many Canadians may cook inwardly against anger if they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">They all love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say "apologies."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter to me, for example, if you would switch me to Johnny from Dallas for example."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"but there are also some problems with the stamp" "nice." ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">"firstly: being called" "nice" "is basically to be spooky - like the benevolent, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has one's own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being innocuous means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major part of the Canadian."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to only take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What external standing as "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open kindness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada really sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a music video that is famous in Thailand has released a music video that parodils the Junta, which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the ongoing military supremacy of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos, which are referring to some of the political issues that Thailand has persisted in the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives absolute decision making over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program for the" Adjustment Change "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are regarded as critics of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slandered the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strife against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic insult).</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "confusion" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and golden earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it's rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outdoors on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication which they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm, exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurchin) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston where she can find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the track and that Africans talk to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let her go again," he answered, smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to salute her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single-educator, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles the travelers consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair care, she made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sorrowfully while she imagines her briefly.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, as well as"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the people of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the cell phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi got a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" prevents access to terrorist information. ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities tried to use the app for more than fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police notice that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control your home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filtering for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting on digital censorship in China mainly focuses on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme engravings and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">Photos from a checkpoint where police officers checked the inhabitants randomly to check whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected in a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances designed for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"also released a Jingwang product description from which the software can unlock the password requirements of a Windows operating system, thus receiving unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutes are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when they operate their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report from Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on 27 June, the authorities published a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 to register their" personal ID cards, mobile devices, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumqui's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2000">"all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence, even if the Earth is on the axis of the Unholy. you realize that you have been trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>

<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest as weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been stuffed into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke through the silence by shouting" "Allahu Akbar" "several times from my house roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I listened to my voice through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>

<seg id="2013">"at such a moment, you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp, but it simply doesn't care about you in the slightest."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet with the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice, after you screamed it all the way to the office of the security service from the body."</seg>

<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>

<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I regret not a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell and I attacked an old-tried method of communication: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell-level was a" "first-year-ling". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>

<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>

<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was ventilated: to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from releasing the traitor and terrorists in us, they played in the alawitic dialect - and they betrayed their sectarian blackmail and betrayed the close eye of view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house that is not a country here; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clans into a hero.</seg>

<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I had to get used to it, to be punished, even though I did nothing to make this punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams were not yet enough, which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator used to work as a garbage collector or if it belonged to normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables intertwined in order to present us the great invention of a giant cable, from their point of view."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour three of them alternated, while I was still in the row."</seg>

<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, which is why he's next to an electrically charged stick."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"power flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole district."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body, lying on the floor, was the perfect power conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>

<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which happened to me like minutes."</seg>

<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"in principle, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the waits of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if you take a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in the public during Ramadan, in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordan's Ministry of Interior has announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontssinger Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the MPs and former press spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian nation as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "which continues to be elected" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional gender norms by turning his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-led unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who should trust them."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of 'honorary killings' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of victims of domestic violence or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of infamilial violence can" "indefinitely be held in prison" "and for their release is often a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family necessary that the woman has nothing to do."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes that have long been considered a taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, and cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been inverted to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity. "</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the nucleus can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality were censored by LGBTQ + individuals until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya, to later note that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but streamed only a machined version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuv, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks, if Abu Nuv, who was to work on behalf of the caliph later, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not believe it?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemite kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service noted several former government deputies and members of the Association of Teachers, with the reason they had critical comments in social media about the problems rooted in the country rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan did not stop Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "experience it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will bring about genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resists resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one thought that it is a variant of Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the forlorries, drums and dancing have come from a time in which armies marched from the west of Japan to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the disciples to their knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to snatch some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 metre high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population in this region could not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most centric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to trade young people to trade their weapons against hairdressing tools and to obtain training in hairdresser art, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we have built up this educational community."</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel empowering to counteract affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo Párraga, from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, before the Colombians, there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians should join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">He continued to talk about sharing his love with people this year that needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I would never have thought that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Council of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC turned up as they had previously done to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Camillo" "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed lay a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said," "Hello, what do they do?" "he replied," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that's why I answer." "then suddenly tears ran across the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him completely, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hungertod." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"that is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the aim of this order is to overcome all obstacles," "one of them said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give a smile and hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians have been prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without arms."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">Activists witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a damoclasp on the LGBTQ community there has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago after reports published, which dealt with the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after having experienced a group of Chechens of the sex equation of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she went to the USA in the end."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos from my documents were made by WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on 10 October 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying:" here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" how long do you want to dishonour the family, you junk? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and began to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid, in the men or the women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya in order to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running above without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was only bad things, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the whole Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car stood under the window with a dark window panes and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"I left the country with her help, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her without registering me, without identification, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think you're feeling safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about sex equation, this is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian items in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look at how the person looks at which they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told us that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock out a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood gratification."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still trapped in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there are not so many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to judge Kadyrows's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are captured there in order to be able to present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but deliberately dipped to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003, I was already well known in Grosny when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" civilisation, "but finally thrown us back into the stone age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked up; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never curbed me with just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Spire not about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes in front of you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had laughed and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came home, I could feel the situation in the Republic worsened steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreurs, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I clipped off the type of influx.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bobbins."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestaner who have the Cabardines have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transients to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different attitudes of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional?"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should be female in general."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I speak on skin color, racism, black cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices and "sing Kumbaya, my Lord," in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't associate myself as a black woman who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourn complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a bad and marginalized being in historical regard."</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join group groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and sex, because some of them will continue to honour the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different sources a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "still lies in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recall (about: Africa-Womanism: as we reconquer ourselves), we can also create spaces in which they can be fully assured and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-spouse, who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena for abuse, Ada Báez did not find anything useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the prosecution authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strips and Statistical 2 Unvisible maltreatment and a legal system that does not include any of Paraguay's laws: good approach, lack of implementation blows and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Egyz, a social science research institution in Paraguay." "there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay", "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available figures are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 ads of domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the courts of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually shown."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this will come to any woman who will not do this," she explained to the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder is not an independent crime in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to her estimates, a woman died in Paraguay every ten days because of violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she didn't want it, but then she gave up. this should always be regrettable."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years, she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most vulnerable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they can be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mistreated it."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental maltreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads to the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she took a trial against her former partner who developed into an impermeable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay's laws: good approach, lack of implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, known as the hashtag # Porelas (# Prince)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees that Femizid is to explain and to punish offensively as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislative text was modified in a number of points to also win MEPs for the law that are generally forbidden to decriminalize abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill foresaw, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs that the victims of violence must bear at present themselves if they just want to reimburse and receive a secure accommodation to the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get out of action."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse for such a long time until ill treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed."</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to re-intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"the cancellation of the words" gender, "" political violence "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law is regarded as a great setback."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: firstly there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, the research carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the director of central laboratory on the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself searched for the HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the Sambian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I have just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain a receiver, instead of being a man himself."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does finance and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines only make articles accessible for payment (the so-called" paywall "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com's website, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents do not only apply to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still cultivates lettuce, but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like lying in a river a boulder around which I must dull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, nobody can breed a new type of salad because all features are already patented." "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement growing ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS ate and ate red Roman salat of the Outredgeous variety in the" "greenhouse" "of the station."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." "open source" "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately break out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to it, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed, as it is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available freely, as opposed to patented seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited, shrinks."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked with carrots and their availability in her PhD thesis."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suspect that large-scale grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such, because they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predicable due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is another breeder, because" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for a long time to breed into plants, adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in all, Morton interferes with the concept of being patented:" we don't really create the features ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Depeppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi member of the Executive Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" he who breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are required mass herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto), they create most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also convinced that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative:" "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years", "he says." "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is the centre with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to get to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot be simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, one explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend to crop seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for the Hivos' Program for Open Source 'seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems for which scheduled start-up next year should be the official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, to exchange and improve seed policy, so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has particular attention to where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people aware that even more is behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air coffee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the force of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" "Extra" "known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published on August 16, the editorial" This is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens from the civilized standard and what happens in Rio, will be published in the section" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which is only shooting and then asking questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm any more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">"the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"this security policy also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, to conquer a Favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this has actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has become increasingly under attack following several reports on chicans and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux borrowed from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people."</seg>

<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"thanks to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become indispensable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics educate the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>

<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began with the "production of mushrooms coming from the regions" before examining their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a bigger tank. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after 3 months they have distributed fungi throughout East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on October 21 in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in the Galicia region, where there were 4 dead."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, there was a similar tragedy in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European Forestry Monitoring System, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2845">The goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil defence was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federal Government of Portugal declared the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this: there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire.</seg>

<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, spread to the fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"to these problems, the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October when people searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative which provided the population with information: it took advantage of its own civilian protection data using the application focast.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website had more than half a million requests."</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf was found again in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his small salary, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar, heavier than he himself, to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked as well."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy people."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high incidence ratios. however, it is true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception center if they officially submit an application for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbounded lifespan helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2915">"in recent years some of the companies operated by Afghans, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants were created."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
