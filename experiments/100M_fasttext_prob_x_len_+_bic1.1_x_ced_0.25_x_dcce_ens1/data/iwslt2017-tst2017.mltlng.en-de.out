this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally ab@@ used tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on an aw@@ nings , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they have years of information that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to orph@@ ans . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources are able to hide more and more .
&quot; rather than to fail and bring tears to the testimony , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly concerned his telephone lines , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credits , and even travel documents with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first draft constitution , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet been written as R@@ isen &apos;s book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source communication system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot proc@@ ure more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to apply mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
or the next environmental contribut@@ or who warns against the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes , but to protect all of our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain a statement . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain a statement . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain a statement . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
also there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like a lot of a spy or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems weeping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it to myself like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is . &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably , because there have so far been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data dock from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , some US states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to pick up particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all to a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how to transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it is not a single top politi@@ cian wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it &apos;s about how the system works through the corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; this may sound very absurd , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever been changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind this .
&quot; representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws .
&quot; together we can finally stop the In@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I once almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made a back sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what was my rock climbing ? &quot;
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on to@@ e tips to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , including a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could at the same time find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to sleep with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
&quot; no one , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get to the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbor .
this quietly approaching panic you are feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , kitchen , toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone now ? &quot;
could you please tell us on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first imagined with his name ; if he had told how he comes from , how does his dog or his children mean ? &quot;
imagine you have 150 jud@@ gements that everyone says : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel when you &apos;d have to hand over your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their jud@@ gements before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; we trust the people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation sets out simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company relies on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we didn &apos;t expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been met before . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service department . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; if trust is working , won@@ dro@@ us can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know at all .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you to feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay does not work . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trading .
&quot; but now just to call it &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , you can compare it with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling were a rich buffet made of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub @-@ pent@@ our neighborhood of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to the clas@@ h ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow society and relations to us , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place of stay were offered .
were given to people whose children were out@@ stri@@ pped . incub@@ ator programs were started .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why exactly did our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this big impact , I wonder what we could use soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in securing the che@@ que at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people like me .
a study showed that 80 % of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that Americans think , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber riders .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry my hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , dou@@ b@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that anyone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves somehow ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should we do that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went down into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
we went into our apartment this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; S@@ ame yourselves not . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings heard : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , and struck them in the open . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when first of all , the person is cut off from her community , even from her family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts hate the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people going to the mosque . &quot;
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; after all , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups assert their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit with whom she had spoken brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m returned to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept trying to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consuming fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted for military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to increase the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about self @-@ explaining . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife , Yus@@ or , were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was st@@ un@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is this a sealed young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he sm@@ iled at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we wanted to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , and my shoes went out , went to the praying hall , and what I saw was holding me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is shortly before becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air p@@ act has penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the narrow@@ est space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can float and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind bu@@ cks .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions that come to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of mobile parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
decades ago trained pilots have been able to fly remote controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder .
we recently discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one moving part , one prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the interior life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right , if everyone is watching me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in car@@ el@@ essness , this machine is here , the omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is not symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at this .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the reward is in the development and the act of creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth second . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit more brigh@@ tly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy freely in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was em@@ itted into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; at first , we arrange the events in time . &quot;
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , a number of years ago had just emerged on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that arise about through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition rate enormously . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes pl@@ otted through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a strengthening in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , teachers often lead to a properly alpine dance in courses for rel@@ ativity theory . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched by us when the waves hit . the stretch of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite handy , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
in tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot easily create images of objects in the universe with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so , when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , we can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , easily circul@@ ate : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o Fol@@ lowing : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see .
&quot; Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through as these are opa@@ que .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own reflection . &quot;
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and probably the most important thing : I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work , so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately , as we went forth out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists in being as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cling of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , I eliminated my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a definite yes that pro@@ found@@ ly changed my life to an unexpected way . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things get out of my life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cir@@ cl@@ ed television . I produce television .
&quot; I do television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
each shipment has hundreds of jobs which did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days , four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that simultaneously are in production : 24 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes I have created and not only produced , so even overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather around my fans around the bon@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you are now a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and it is true when I say : I understand that it is not dre@@ aming about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of not@@ hing@@ ness .
it &apos;s like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a result , you run a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I explain to them the sums that I speak about writing , that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I started working with television production , when I started working and working and doing , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you cannot go differently than for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I haven &apos;t done for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more broad@@ casts I become , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the tot@@ als . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ laid , burned out . &quot;
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single working institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there but you can write to my N@@ anny .
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; bi@@ kers , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ country . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine st@@ alled .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing del@@ egi@@ stering , a titanium does not sleep , does not exist , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a flagship Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just couldn &apos;t have fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; Watch out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , you love what you &apos;re doing , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a painter , Bill Gates . &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of myself :
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me . &quot;
she calls no one more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m playing titanium and my hum@@ ming bed , and here everything changes from my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of summ@@ ing , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ ft@@ ings and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The King@@ doms . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of money , the sums of money , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using programmes and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
real sums are dependent on love .
the sum is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sums are simple and original .
&quot; the real sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to God , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not so easy to play as you work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I &apos;m too relaxed , none of it . &quot;
&quot; we move around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we quit playing ?
you can also ! tell them if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and when my teen@@ age daughter talks with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood @-@ day ! &quot;
15 minutes in one piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the h@@ um , to have a place for his peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children .
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything that I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not take a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown tune , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the summ@@ its . the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the tot@@ als , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sum : the sum of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sw@@ um , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I get you to life . &quot;
&quot; that is part of the job , which means living your dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent and severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
&quot; it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe tre@@ mor and severe pain . &quot;
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with a skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that the brain har@@ ms the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so . &quot;
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology lessons , that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fo@@ etus , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they remain to us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we provoked her to the est@@ ran@@ gement of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we wi@@ pe these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we wi@@ pe the same cells into fo@@ amed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been m@@ apped .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; after that the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injuries .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we her@@ m@@ bled the cells : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it of course .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable ge@@ dness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are wasted , our future glo@@ omy and wasted our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the mountain of debt , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but they are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and income that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchanges and adverti@@ se the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily leads the circumstances leading to the killing of oil .
this is my coat with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is the world of corporations -- has been a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , while the economy gradually under@@ goes politics and dis@@ regards it . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be in the government nowadays , and still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , that at the end they star@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , political goods are de@@ valued , economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ us &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem here is , as long economy and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin peaks become higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united zone , otherwise we end up in a mor@@ bid surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; which is similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the company area : imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all income comes from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it &apos;s basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal institution in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a matrix - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers design@@ ates as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supp@@ er &apos;s dinner you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of them play , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically considered .
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
it was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second . &quot;
&quot; to acc@@ use China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive de@@ fle@@ ction line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- that , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Ern@@ sting ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extending the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us was , &quot; &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism from the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; if they do not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard the majority , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
&quot; if your show is reviewed with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make your brain wonder : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to stop &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle pron@@ unciation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can look for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for free , do you have access right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and it reads : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com with four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many can &apos;t remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , of which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com with four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . it &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could prec@@ ede influ@@ xes of influ@@ enza , the bad type , -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly did not work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the case of legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I recognized some samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
&quot; do you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts together and then come to a resolution .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is important to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of . however , the decision on how to put all these parts together and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first competing for TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; this is what the data tells us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will turn it off later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
