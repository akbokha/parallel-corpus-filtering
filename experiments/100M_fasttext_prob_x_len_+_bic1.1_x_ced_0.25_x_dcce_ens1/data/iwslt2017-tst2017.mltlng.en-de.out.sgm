<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA has illegally abused telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA gave literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked on an awnings, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they have years of information that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to orphans."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources are able to hide more and more.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and bring tears to the testimony, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly concerned his telephone lines,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credits, and even travel documents with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first draft constitution, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet been written as Risen's book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open source communication system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot procure more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to apply misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental contributor who warns against the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain a statement.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain a statement.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain a statement.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervously for the next release and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like a lot of a spy or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it to myself like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have so far been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data dock from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, some US states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to pick up particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all to a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not a single top politician wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it's about how the system works through the corruption, evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very absurd, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever been changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite well that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been gathering in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind this.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency by laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally stop the Intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I once almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made a back sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what was my rock climbing? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, including a mattress and breakfast each morning. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could at the same time find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people publish public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite wild people to sleep with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you get to the things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly approaching panic you are feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, kitchen, toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first imagined with his name; if he had told how he comes from, how does his dog or his children mean?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 judgements that everyone says: "he can really capture very well unlocked mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd have to hand over your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their judgements before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"we trust the people most, who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sets out similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm doing holiday with my family. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company relies on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service department. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust is working, wondrous can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you to feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay does not work."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just to call it" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, you can compare it with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling were a rich buffet made of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub-pentour neighborhood of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to the clash?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow society and relations to us, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place of stay were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were outstripped. incubator programs were started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this big impact, I wonder what we could use soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in securing the cheque at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show that Americans think, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry my hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you oppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that anyone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet loves somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word" breaking message. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... Muslim terrorists...,... "in the name of Islam...,..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate course."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove silently -- as deep as it went down into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">We went into our apartment this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Same yourselves not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings heard:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, and struck them in the open."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when first of all, the person is cut off from her community, even from her family, so that the extremists hate the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"after all, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit with whom she had spoken brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization through extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam returned to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept trying to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consuming fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted for military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to increase the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about self-explaining."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife, Yusor, were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is this a sealed young man out of my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we wanted to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took it out, and my shoes went out, went to the praying hall, and what I saw was holding me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the meeting were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>

<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters, it can float and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft will be able to regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions that come to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with thousands of mobile parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots have been able to fly remote controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We recently discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one moving part, one propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the interior life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right, if everyone is watching me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward is in the development and the act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth second."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit more brightly than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy freely in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was emitted into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"at first, we arrange the events in time."</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, a number of years ago had just emerged on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves that arise about through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition rate enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes plotted through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a strengthening in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, teachers often lead to a properly alpine dance in courses for relativity theory."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched by us when the waves hit. the stretch of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite handy, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot easily create images of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so, when we transform wave patterns into sound, we can hear the universe literally speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation, we can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, easily circulate: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same cirpen with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo Following: [Surrender noise] Somebody who knows what to hear, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is obscured by its own reflection."</seg>
<seg id="541">Gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dinosaurs for our archaeological work, so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the formation of the stars and ultimately, as we went forth out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists in being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circling of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things get out of my life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I circled television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs which did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days, four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that simultaneously are in production: 24 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes I have created and not only produced, so even overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather around my fans around the bonfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I'm a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you are now a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and it is true when I say: I understand that it is not dreaming about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothingness.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, you run a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, if I explain to them the sums that I speak about writing, that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I started working with television production, when I started working and working and doing, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you cannot go differently than for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I haven't done for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more broadcasts I become, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the humming, the humming, the totals."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overlaid, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there but you can write to my Nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "bikers, I want to go to Shonda-country."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stalled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegistering, a titanium does not sleep, does not exist, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a flagship Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just couldn't have fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think," "Watch out, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're doing what you're doing, you love what you're doing, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a painter, Bill Gates."</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late, and she says:" "mum, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of myself:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no one more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm playing titanium and my humming bed, and here everything changes from my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax craftings and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in" The Kingdoms. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of money, the sums of money, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using programmes and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums are dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums are God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to God, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not so easy to play as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what kind of person is better than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I'm too relaxed, none of it."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we move around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we quit playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me naïve, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teenage daughter talks with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it's just 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can take 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood-day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in one piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the hum, to have a place for his peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children.</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "is short for everything that I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not take a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown tune, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the hum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totality of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it's snowing me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the summits. the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the totals, the humming, the other, the right sum: the sum of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this swum, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I'm a writer. I think things out, I get you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that is part of the job, which means living your dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent and severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">"it really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremor and severe pain."</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with a skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain harms the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Being able to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François was able to do so."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology lessons, that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the foetus, they care for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we provoked her to the estrangement of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we wipe these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we wipe the same cells into foamed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added a violation and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been mapped.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor range in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"after that the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injuries.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we hermbled the cells: the same monkey, two months after the irritation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable gedness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unequivocally clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are wasted, our future gloomy and wasted our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, but they are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and income that humanity urgently needs, for example" "green" "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the US, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulate in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and advertise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not equalled by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily leads the circumstances leading to the killing of oil.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my coat with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the Athenian democracy because of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive which they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenic democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is the world of corporations -- has been a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two takes place, while the economy gradually undergoes politics and disregards it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be in the government nowadays, and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, decimated, that at the end they starved."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, political goods are devalued, economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demus "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and extravagance."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem here is, as long economy and politics are separate areas, automation lets the twin peaks become higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited zone, otherwise we end up in a morbid surveillance hyperautocracy which lets the film" matrix "appear as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "which is similar to that of society in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of "matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples shortly."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the company area: imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It's basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal institution in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a matrix - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers designates as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will destabilise not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am completely incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supper's dinner you said very clearly what you think of the West's view on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of them play, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I can say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to accuse China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells huge after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to complacency, and the continuous denial that a massive deflection line passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- that, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Ernsting...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for extending the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions caused by the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika who imposed this policy on us was," "This was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism from the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"if they do not survive, the exposed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard the majority, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is reviewed with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that make your brain wonder:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to stop "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle pronunciation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can look for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for free, do you have access right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and it reads:" "Amazon should make a sitcom with four Republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many can't remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, of which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom with four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis doesn't work, it's a bit scary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. it's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could precede influxes of influenza, the bad type, -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the case of legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I recognized some samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"do you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, disassemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts together and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is important to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of. however, the decision on how to put all these parts together and make it a show like" House of Cards "does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first competing for TV ideas than they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "this is what the data tells us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will turn it off later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a little more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
