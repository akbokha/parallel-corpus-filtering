Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel where now it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows who had to be exciting already because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - yet very revealing . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a fli@@ ck@@ ish carpet that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; in the large over@@ sight map , more detailed maps , called ur@@ anium leaves , were incorporated into the cities and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ ve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; after all , when the French troops stri@@ pped off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Sur@@ ve@@ ying Management . &quot;
the document for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / Today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming a small card appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ in numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; today , small plots prove no more farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , the scene of the October festival , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the judgment leaf , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at guest ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ft@@ - &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was established . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought to King Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ation of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also forbi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first room , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
&quot; West is located in the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural acc@@ la@@ im to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the allies of the Al@@ lies seized many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel dating back to the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes Travel Guide for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents occur throughout the state and are noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who dispro@@ portion@@ ate minority interests , led the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
the Council also pointed out a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office where it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people have to be willing to bring money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which acc@@ ru@@ ed the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to acc@@ la@@ im a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had passed immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing according to the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
turn@@ out project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher pasture fence project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of the German parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two depu@@ ties met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider .
&quot; at first Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann gave insights into his operations , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday resorts . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively region@@ ales .
&quot; since he is also chairman of the fishing village B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the turn@@ out project as &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot create profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
&quot; grass@@ land care for a lot of work , much needs to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if it does not lead to bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that this way the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be dra@@ gged down for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to keep their business going , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the storage area is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of € 71 500 , half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 km of gra@@ zing fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you &apos;re doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the landscape care policy ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of gra@@ zing f@@ ences .
the objective is to open the Black Forest .
the pre @-@ requ@@ isite is the presence of a conveyor system designated by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the fence may not be in@@ effective ( Han@@ gn@@ ment exceeds 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ tling project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans cher@@ ish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated debate with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue herself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have ma@@ stered it if he had done it .
&quot; but he dealt with their importance , and in particular the significance which you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he himself formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your afflicted masses , who desire to breathe freely , and the poor waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; ending waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a high political act .
the sculpture was meant to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
&quot; Lazarus was changing this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself another name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus altered the significance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not call anyone , but rather an early neo@@ conservative , that puts the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch is not meant to illumin@@ ate the road to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is wholly and at all a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ ful , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on ships of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever like to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch will not light the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship negoti@@ ator will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner of the street .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was unbelievable , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with her fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the UK team . &quot;
Schot@@ t@@ lands &apos;s best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; the Mu@@ ir , the middle @-@ distance runner , leads on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records . &quot;
&quot; it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also at med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
&quot; block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office , if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked in the criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second @-@ highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair loose head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is paid officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ essed . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , wasn &apos;t hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are rather dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; focused spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lead articles or arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that exactly happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County rejected the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck his leadership . &quot;
and even back then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the Arch@@ er@@ field links up to the final round last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home ground . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m happy about how it went so far .
&quot; the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and senior major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ antes . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot is £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer . &quot;
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoking a year , &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; says the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze farm . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed because there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction team of St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers against red lights and shut @-@ off it@@ ters is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to transit .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use any stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ligh@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ stran@@ t in the quiet ind@@ on@@ ese province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a , &quot; directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the knot@@ ted tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , such as washing dresses with mud from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from corrugated roofs , which have been transformed into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua , Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people who make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 of Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s have become genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing , &quot; in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bolts have been reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants started selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and the violations of law in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ligh@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them they should turn on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took offen@@ se on their sound and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , drove and beat the group with their rif@@ le @-@ guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so badly that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military detach@@ ment for demanding justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - continuously and a bird singing im@@ itating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that hasn &apos;t been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ligh@@ ali , looked at the threatening danger and called for peace and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 , that he will judge an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , frigh@@ tened to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid of discussing the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing a warning .
but local people say that the mobile Bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an inv@@ oc@@ ation for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the Free &quot; &quot; Papua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , sold in red @-@ red , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire has arrived in greater numbers . &quot;
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; in addition , Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete in their own businesses . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; beyond that , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they were given rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most troubled provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
the lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically endor@@ sed the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they might never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
it is the second fire that swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years by chance the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and scre@@ aming the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who attacked his name as George ang@@ ler , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said they were working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building , following its fire in 2015 , revealed that most of the damages came from the cl@@ adding , the out@@ lining for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Meeting .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play the Davis Cup single was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport revolutionary proposal . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but also very much appreciated Five @-@ Set classics are thus preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal came before the proposal to finish the final in a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the next round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. will be reli@@ eved and the players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects into the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited objects have been smu@@ g@@ gled to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dently wore prohibited knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed that they had been late discovered that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey for more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet Charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; more than 3 percent gave up , know@@ ingly worn objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently brought smu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security , and how many would have done it intentionally . &quot;
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the safety of those who fly most often .
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest quantity of items seized by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la clients cancelled order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customers had withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal another , less brilliant figure for the first time at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders . &quot;
critics repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Payment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could be made to the problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 it is expected to be - all models - 500@@ ,000 - a million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today must expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , yet never tested production lines with maximum occup@@ ancy . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to bigger delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; after all , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s because of the hes@@ itation of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his prior position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for the down @-@ down o@@ zone . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a prior to his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly attempted to block or delay regul@@ ators , which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts Reg@@ ular roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane gas . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ ing in o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often kept the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement the deadline for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority we give us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EP@@ O said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers , &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on sound politics and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight . &quot;
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environmental conserv@@ ation@@ ists che@@ ered for a surprising course change .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step away from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe in , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue fighting against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to tackle environmental pollution and their particular interests .
Tum@@ ble celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bling to their request .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
&quot; in the year 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ isches certificate of documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ ble along with the Abbey of Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document according to the documents , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people living there .
&quot; as from the description of the Freuden@@ stadt Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still recognizable today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ ble , the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval village law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit this church . &quot;
this was associated with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two sh@@ attered at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were pla@@ stered and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary Church was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower could be stopped .
&quot; in the New Years Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; only the tower , which still exists today , was preserved as a witness of the 750 year old church history . &quot;
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as a successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bling on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Mr. Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is at 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; for the seren@@ ity of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers provide fantastic views . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of significance for Tum@@ our and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini affir@@ ms .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; was invited by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a form defect . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirement , the granted allowance is still un@@ lawful and therefore to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break , a permit from the District government still stands out . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; in doing so , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out by law . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writings have been received by the Circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle makes it an occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four hundred metres high wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of about 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ person households . &quot;
the NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was killed in a fatal way .
two more people were injured easily .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch was driving the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ des@@ a and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to shopping in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to which offers the own city has in store away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market , is planned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center invite to the &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this makes the commercial association and the city move into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ known well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be newly or re@@ developed . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly wi@@ ped out , had told King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Director of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will participate in five Thür@@ inger cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mm@@ er@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote &quot; the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her own environment by himself .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school

Tru@@ mp replaced Mexico under pressure by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp called on a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president denoun@@ ced him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States emig@@ rated to take over &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade negotiated by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on refugee res@@ ett@@ lement to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull &apos; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massac@@ res : activists resur@@ rec@@ t rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ 1948 Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block their way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer @-@ suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled apart from the passenger &apos;s seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene was played on July 22 , only one post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience hit very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in the organisation of the post @-@ ordination . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the state of Georgia , and a life @-@ long civil law firm . &quot;
&quot; for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician speci@@ fies a sheet about the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FB@@ I files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one ever was accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the ground for decades , citizen rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote in Georgia for the first time . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore did not stem from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid $ 600 to deliver Mal@@ com from prison , the FB@@ I . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they came from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , eliminating the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivi@@ dly , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors joined forces - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - in a room and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of boss clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries out and har@@ assed him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , --- he , wa@@ ving from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ch@@ ich@@ ing . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a dress of sad@@ ness , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actor and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays in the sad@@ ness of &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ ped sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
&quot; a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as &apos;s oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , record the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks Gre@@ ene - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at one table , a white couple from Atlanta talking about the reproduction with a black couple that they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do it , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch continues to go on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police @-@ shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding his yard at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ ordination is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production of gigantic , six @-@ story scenes . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ tö@@ chter pose as a rock@@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ tö@@ chter - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise like already in Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
&quot; Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier , dec@@ ei@@ ves a corp@@ se into the trunk and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fe@@ ather@@ ed Hagen around which surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ghted bo@@ ar .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with great applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated in a stor@@ my way . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in le@@ aner leisure wear . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ory of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto in 2013 , and there were five years later big jubil@@ ations in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in stock@@ ings in the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have been working on the school already in an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a degree of civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
crowd : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ n Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where to do his FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing for me .
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works .
what is different from the degree of civil engineering ?
&quot; of course , it is not a question of calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people &apos;s mind , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager has been brought out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; a lot of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is like that . &quot;

&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ ten its interim dividend by 72 percent since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , the job cuts , CEO John Fall@@ on , announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will in addition come to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack killed in suicide attacks by NATO
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , a military con@@ vo@@ y , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and shared a statement by Nato .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a Nato statement , the explosion on Thursday evening was to be done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of US forces supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA turns out decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ O announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it will show the agency &apos;s obligation to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and because we respond to our state partners , &quot; said S@@ EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations , in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards , to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic countries , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed law@@ suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the democr@@ ats and nature reserves who are concerned about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ds decides to set up a common room in the future sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing part of the plot is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will continue until the area belonging to the church community has been in the community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project that is based on a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council are ho@@ vering to fores@@ ee such a common room not as a meeting point only for residents of the living , but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn by means of funding .
the building is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal is to signal the investor that in this regard , no bil@@ let between the legs is to be thrown , the finding that both saddle - and the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer says that this is the addition . &quot;
when it helps : it is unanim@@ ous that it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of her own buildings , with which you can &apos;t advance so much , but now you lean on the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m struggling with that . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely interested in the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , as with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus , but will receive a real counter @-@ value in the case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to apply the proposed proposal , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so there are two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we touch the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is shot on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told us , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the road Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the bicycle track of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted priority to him .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t look at the opposite . &quot;
he met with a car that contributed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought into a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ gn@@ ette .
FC Bayern Munich must abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game play against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel care at the German football record master Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must renoun@@ ce David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
hiking in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the Harz region , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; to meet the need for information of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , was called . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase by 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be complemented by Internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star@@ Path train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ path the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest peak of Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to de@@ mot@@ ed to the d@@ warf Planet - are placed exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away and measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed about eight hours from the sun to the Plu@@ to , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next stern , however , would take half a year . &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ weight Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ oning World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you going to champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect scale . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended to Bron@@ er , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pound &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to compete in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later pushed open to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he treas@@ ured Lom@@ on@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he could possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko continued with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to get the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that needs to be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injuries to tire bur@@ ners
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 am shortly before the junction of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car dropped to the right into the gu@@ sts , where he over@@ threw himself and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked north@@ wards for about an hour , then traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ises the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first win of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 versus Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimised . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a blow , the For@@ tun@@ ics don &apos;t want to catch up any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ position in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t afford so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good start of the season . &quot;
his coach did not want to know about this .
&quot; at the start of the season , I only judged after six to eight days of play , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be some fres@@ her , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for an ascent favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are the easier favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief Coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age .
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , during X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of human beings in order to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is minimal . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full of the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road and Transport in the Regional Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three needs in need of rehabilitation between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
&quot; this is a marginal fix , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to proceed .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ cent@@ ering feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans initially had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting road towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three frac@@ tions amounts to 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties move to one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the political parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that is peac@@ efully flag on this day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to be &quot; &quot; large election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , is the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D developers , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well @-@ square , but now takes place on the parking place below the rear seat - and thus right in front of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel was reported to have tried for such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is also the case : at 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the Rh@@ en@@ ish Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch holding her speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; for more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police cannot move - no special incidents .
trumpet meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Posa@@ un@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ lach Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ate of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the soloist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire to transc@@ end not only the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , classical , jazz and free games ming@@ le with a fascinating total art work . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I join grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the one of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately fell bitter@@ ly apart . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette of the act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was deeply in love with each one I had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but at school time , as she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public does not like to explain her love life : &quot; people expect you to get in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me some ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes finds that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to resume sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been cut off gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot;
the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
CO@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics champi@@ onships that start in London on Friday , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers cut down in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
&quot; in addition , Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained thing . &quot;
they called the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from northern h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church accepted par@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral procession started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the gh@@ o@@ sts laid down roses , the relatives standing arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ ers and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen designated the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot;
the stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers were , said , &quot; If this occupation could not turn away the crash it would not have been possible . &quot;
&quot; doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance to a country of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot;
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also put the title &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ crat , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
&quot; at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flo@@ under@@ ing , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 years of reign . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ uts instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a spe@@ edy re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party from its Parliament faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover thus lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ wel@@ ve explained their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
Prime Minister Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record it .
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag decides the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities have to be checked legally properly , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally properly tested . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ sm@@ and@@ at , which she has received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; shared the regional chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests extraordinarily . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead a foreign language in the faction .
&quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Member States El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats Group on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of the west will cost Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &apos;s office &quot; in her last vanity and fru@@ stration of her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to strike political capital from it .
Prime Minister Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his depu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was strongest in the time before the SPD , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) spoke in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder set up the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all that we know at present , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightened person is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; in the same way , retailers have to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if the residual hardness of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , they are not easy to transport . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ polluted eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , production plants are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too little controllers in serious cases . &quot;
is it lacking only at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made clear that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to receive only safe and competitive foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly felt . &quot;
&quot; as a result , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ carrying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation which monitors the European game has the power to forbi@@ d teams of access to the prestigious champion League tournament . &quot;
financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer was financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; with security , PS@@ G can easily make the money loose , so N@@ ey@@ mar has signed and put it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they have to counter with legitimate income sources that enable them to break even the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had lost enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current 3 @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , making the revenues for the next five years worth 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs to try to rev@@ ise their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies connected with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come over payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors are becoming and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could simply be figur@@ ing out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will still be more attentive to observe any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing dealers , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey purchases . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the finan@@ ci@@ er Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new global supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y has made Fre@@ y Board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order . &quot;
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ gg@@ ings of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders value the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual revenues of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a shock @-@ gi@@ ver manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to betra@@ y like many applicants with the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018 . &quot;
for the s@@ da the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement .
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss Life has been distributing chocol@@ ates boards on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the launch of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long haul flights , the customers of First Class are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in business class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; on the short stretch , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot;

no@@ stal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ time turned the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent remin@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time is short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd lob@@ ster ( it contained an original story for a promising D@@ ose vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by tre@@ ading on the core of the G@@ ags , middle @-@ aged actors play tight children who are grown - they still create the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the te@@ at . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering principle , including a reef on the stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character rum@@ mage through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the am@@ i@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ time ) , now a novel@@ ist , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy malign@@ ant plot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ time ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as usual , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that this fran@@ chise might like as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon re@@ members another kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West ring @-@ struggle icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose dialo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to view ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; at six long episodes , it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was reduced to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef consistently visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a fortune .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; with the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been established against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large insert on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , most of the Italian nation@@ als had a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the gang . &quot;
way to complain large gaps in the for@@ eigner register
&quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country @-@ country registry . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data registered there could lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to figures , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data had been found in 1921 , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; however , such false attri@@ butions led &quot; to a distorted debate on the handling of sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper wrote on the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU State , which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten illegal admission conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 liters of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service provided by other people . &quot;
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community recognizes at the meeting of the council the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the coordinator of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ en@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ en@@ bacher reported of the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the D@@ RK circle manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the switch to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a um@@ lau@@ rels counted among the multi @-@ don@@ keys and were awarded for 50 donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ver@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter delivered 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice for ten times . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when it provided interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure .
&quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members reaching an increase in this month , because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the domestic income would continue , while inflation is likely to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to re@@ strain the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that loan costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic stimulus package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will require time for financing to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central prog@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption . &quot;
they reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; degree than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that enh@@ ancements would be &quot; step @-@ by @-@ step &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % , compared with the forecast predicted in May . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest increase , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % rose to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening will be worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent the in@@ comes break &quot; &quot; over the next few years , but she added that wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes after a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote caused by the fall of the sound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation declined from 2.@@ 9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the exceed@@ ance in relation to its target of 2 % would be &quot; wholly &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders would like to search for shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages take out , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the medicine at N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ position pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be the first to register people and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV @-@ drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in cases of infection risk .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a GP can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer of NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted to needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the ending of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the Big Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; said Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurbished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the pre@@ text .
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; not only was it possible to build a simple platform , but put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine level , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mirrors play a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room . &quot;
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units space for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter @-@ important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important but they do not play with your heart .
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard into something quite amazing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers have four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - written by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court record says that this means that Col@@ in owns property of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , ruled him out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the quar@@ rel . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ep Shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; Luke , Mark and Mark , &quot; Paul &quot; had become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in with@@ held herself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tru@@ mp &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship to television last decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of places that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; said former election advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite to Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mps Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials in it , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mps &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been under control , is ridi@@ culous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
&quot; if his associates managed to keep him away from him for a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it from provo@@ king tru@@ mp controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp Material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors , the president for strategic reasons doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody said malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for schi@@ ik@@ anen , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked her . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impulse self , and his consultants are still striving for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the people will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe are sending post@@ cards to dangerous criminals during this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known in nature , evidence from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the action that followed the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experience would have shown that many fle@@ es hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online hym@@ ns could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travelers on foot who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn up by the community in order to demand a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by the tren@@ ches dug by the Council , in order to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense and pressed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it is &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame on its implementation , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks .
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my municipal dest@@ ones , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous we have just seen the last round of those travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the ground beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents call on anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is built from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1st next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente Entrepren@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time of the Municipal Council .
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building construction containers since a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; very bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment needed , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee wrote the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , relying on the subject familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper wrote the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ cast@@ ed that there were already first dischar@@ ges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to specifically intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as advis@@ er of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tru@@ mp private and business environment under scrut@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o Tru@@ mp had personally moved to the centre and under@@ went the accus@@ ation whether the president may hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible crime incidents and decide whether to apply charges .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called accus@@ ations .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with major and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office to invite people to inter@@ ro@@ gate under oath .
&quot; according to CN@@ N , demonstrations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; those who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner were also involved in the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the set @-@ up show that Mu@@ eller does not want to in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work , and that if it should be necessary , act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but these work normally in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed in it , it was said in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become noisy , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him about an attitude of the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; on Thursday , two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft bill , after which the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o could no longer be dismissed . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has dissolved the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra . &quot;
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the giant Kol@@ oss , which weighs 1,@@ 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is driving north and will probably take two , three years until it has mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to man .
&quot; as far as climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg , research data is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice valves in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken ch@@ os@@ sus has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by great glaci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; on the north of this hill , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; A@@ WI researcher , Daniela Jan@@ sen , writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s there . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never been so far withdrawn as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the chim@@ e leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest scar@@ f of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the polar sign now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most wei@@ ghty withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead to the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg not on climate change , many ice @-@ tu@@ fts of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are crum@@ bling over the past few decades . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the polar area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature increased .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore counts to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate in personnel
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new positions in the administration inst@@ inct . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 apprenti@@ ces have completed their first day of work . &quot;
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be distributed this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
there are currently 50 non @-@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and extern@@ ally , to show concrete measures for Quer@@ ein@@ steiger and include a training campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s peoples , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
he was already worried about a fist big surprise when he questioned the personnel costs and bewil@@ dered the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed to allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county government should strive with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in the alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a position on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew takes din@@ gh@@ y immigrants aboard , which will be delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be re @-@ used . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ u@@ v@@ entr@@ a must first have an Italian police officer who supervised their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Northern Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim on hot summer temperatures .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , look@@ out look@@ out at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ age &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ ation .
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters in altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga prepares for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium racing at wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges . &quot;
these have also recognized the first federal government agencies that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning made 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took under contract two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that there are several clubs on this train .
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London hosted the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be much more present on these markets online than once a year to send the Federal Government to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; during e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just football simulation FIFA will play on competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen has long established itself in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly getting used . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ at has dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses , which are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ rob@@ at also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in online games , inspec@@ tions are difficult to perform , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in the E @-@ Sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted because of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy squee@@ ze for suicide
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ored .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day in which I am not bet@@ ting the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be an ante for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I &apos;ll keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote , &quot; You must do , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was paid by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that it should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern st@@ alls a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt .
&quot; something was different on its place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the tie at his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bayern captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign from the coach could also point me this way .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen in the C @-@ El@@ f of youth players , de@@ fam@@ ers and just off the holiday as a guide , but he . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those you want to have a lot to keep in your mood .
those who have been chosen to embar@@ k on the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir affir@@ med : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; to the right rear , this is now his position , the white binder in the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general , Kim@@ mir made me feel like the one who is best able to take the helm . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
&quot; V@@ idal therefore , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( barely collap@@ sed ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out of the accompl@@ ishments of the Asia trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not have a negative impact on their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ cot . &quot;
at least it worked very well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both operated confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the recently occupied Nap@@ oli storm was very heavy , and addic@@ ted to the game building a couple of times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that the outcome was &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during their debut .
&quot; shifting , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bayern @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new players , after a few clu@@ e statements . &quot;
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I noticed already . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies

the twe@@ ets of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motivation .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein @-@ pe@@ eled minister : economy pra@@ ises d@@ ress@@ ings pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows more than a year , in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously t@@ ad@@ orn the old ministers .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now up to the top in the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 will be the building law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ig@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; the objective is to put the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Industry and Industry of Trier ) stri@@ ves , as is suggested by Wis@@ ser , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports losing 10 years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a bonus of 1,000 euros is provided for the passed master test and 2500 Euros for graduates within ten years after master education . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , but at the same time fail to land the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ ser for mobility at the Landes@@ betrieb are only 29 positions . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to the calculations of the Audi@@ torium , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country was further sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
&quot; former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of discre@@ pan@@ cies she has already cleared the field again . &quot;
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus attracted European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles , also contribute to what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of bre@@ wing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but in normal driving conditions .
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested by Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if it goes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a usual raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to an public awareness campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protected wild river . &quot;
last summer the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of Car@@ to@@ on @-@ Dra@@ fts@@ men &apos;s most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the bun@@ ni@@ es of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he presented himself as an artist for congrat@@ ulation - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the &apos; 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
&quot; even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans . &quot;
again and again the artists of cities let themselves be inspired .
&quot; large , rund@@ own Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the table today , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ l@@ ily figures still find a lot of dissem@@ ination worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counterpart .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced verb@@ lessly . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; because of the conditions of d@@ rought , the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf @-@ ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval feast .
&quot; Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a land camp are to be experienced in the city center on these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt civil servants and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and feelings are sufficient . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected to stand on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while all the country houses the corp@@ ses , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has held his office in December 2012 , there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are their editors and their creator of Ri@@ o@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ eric@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; twel@@ fth river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to say about Val@@ dez .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug @-@ kings , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country at its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the in@@ toxic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever she led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird that could fly like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ o@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who described the governor themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce has b@@ anded on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled by the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we would have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the staff became something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of scor@@ ing journalists and putting them around because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has been asked since then , that it is re@@ group@@ ed by the government because it is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book called &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also by the command of politicians and security forces who were involved in organised crime under a veil . &quot;
the media watch@@ dog group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has reported more than half of the attacks against journalists from the police and civil servants last year .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note signed by the T@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay in addition to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain backward and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to hu@@ g . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with gang riv@@ als and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ als nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &quot; When the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , although a terri@@ fying one . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the persistent ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ d@@ auri@@ er who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth@@ cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ act , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er made head@@ lines in May and now can be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ din@@ osau@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors have to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther far@@ ther than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ od@@ auri@@ er is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you are just a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when gigantic ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the guarded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures on average were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters were swe@@ pt through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the tail@@ oring of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied ves@@ tiges of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin cr@@ ates still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
blocked rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich highway ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured at a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , around 5@@ pm between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no information available about the exact number of injured persons . &quot;
&quot; it was mild to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of the city of Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long back@@ sta@@ u was formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade was the hall@@ mark of the car owners who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , another second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing , you sit in the train and sleep . &quot;
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
&quot; one simply confirms by mobile phone , that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at many other remote routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said S &amp; D spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the name of the train . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
&quot; you also have to purchase it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears as a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
the train atten@@ dant at the ticket control at Platz Y knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navigator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in a personal way , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing manager . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs .
&quot; those who often travel , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are one of the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you must show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the bot@@ toms or large room and delays in the control of their own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; on Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ eten live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her mobile phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we get used to and which we can typically call .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she got her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting at 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the vision of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had on the black experience and the black condition innum@@ erable times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black female child . &quot;
I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground when activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take form for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
a question came into mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ?
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt &apos;s occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront because in a life on these jun@@ ctions it is a black gay woman so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels obliged to remember this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; the Bit @-@ Galerie moves the people , even though it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one .
&quot; on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; , &quot; the topic will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one @-@ bit gallery would say : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be real class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , the end will be the end . &quot;
&quot; the Galerie @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country@@ women are always very happy again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
&quot; we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities this is also possible .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .
but the new project shouldn &apos;t be too low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive above all . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops are hired only by larger companies in a shopping mall , because the r@@ ents there are often not sustainable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the peasant market hall planned during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the ghost bit gallery previously to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I think - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg do not have any room any more . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which almost resem@@ ble itself - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former Secret Service Analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after publicly decre@@ ed diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline has united its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created an algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , among them six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just returned from the great success of its 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as ci@@ gar dum@@ my and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became un@@ equal e@@ ye@@ witnesses who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ mo would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of lucky coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tru@@ mp is introducing a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to fl@@ aming the rigid spl@@ its that it should actually remedy . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological respect , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears in the hands of a free @-@ talk @-@ phone in the hands of the disciplines of the United States such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they strike your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which conver@@ ge like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ ids were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as demonstrated by Cook County &apos;s Local Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corp@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the spot , and det@@ ectives investigate the bul@@ ks as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
since 2007 La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been judged and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA driving plan in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Vice @-@ Re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA driver plan was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA by performing dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employee at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to perform surveys , provide specific groups and demographic groups , to handle employees anonym@@ ity and appeal hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow the C @-@ suite executives to handle and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most discomfort and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that has been punished for those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line to report bad behaviour to employees .
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion poll@@ ed the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that is poorly treated or beha@@ ves eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way of pursuing the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair internship - can be identified and addressed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices , and that the work that you are doing is worthwhile , then they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , staff will ask , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long term this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have stri@@ pped off their tri@@ c@@ ots and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the water man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ges @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually prolonged their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three U@@ C@@ LA workouts should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ges postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as carried out practical exercises in West@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August , 18 exercises are to be held . 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of regulation of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add a further point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ unge , they &apos;re great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been cleared with foot@@ balls , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room there and then adjust themselves there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications of third parties and show their results under the original contribution then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
&quot; the company said in a comment on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify potential false noti@@ fications and to send them to factor checks that may display results of the fac@@ tual test from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to get rid of hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts check is started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fac@@ tual reviews are being challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library , a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; letters always smell smoke , for at that time they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is also involved . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ mine a little &apos; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles which centuries had stayed in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landsc@@ aping , gar@@ dening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust won the full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who what possessed : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed in the 18th century by filling his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , getting debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ ams &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which since then has been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like saying , &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle clo@@ aked in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the closure of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it will be the highlight of the campaign to give a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their website which was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we firmly believe that as a bad Honne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , they are competing with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Honne@@ f , the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension schemes and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , the five vice @-@ ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number . &quot;
the government is pulling up the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a pul@@ ler of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt , will be involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the overthrow of God as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ comfortable in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the major pur@@ thing with the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan had fired another 7@@ 3@@ 95 police officers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the real masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least with calling on the European Union &apos;s reform agenda . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is driving a target of an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a designated officer , who sought asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , NATO could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he reserves the right to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do so by issuing the US the way citizens from other countries are dealt with Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for racing gate shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , again and again , the future of the racing car has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the track on which the tourist railway travels , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing drive , construction work will begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; explained the Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered from the country even in the future , will be finally fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , the route was tested by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also very open in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just when you thought it could not become even crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin taking her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex @-@ d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford wife look progressive .
modern sex@@ t@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy con@@ served with a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to some Dun@@ kl@@ eres and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices its increasing popularity they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps out of the edge zones can be very instruc@@ tive in regards to the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is , however , a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who pra@@ ys to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed bodies and the expelled eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to put it in the mode of speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
shri@@ mps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp .
we are all supposed to let ourselves be placed in order to burst our filter bubbles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp , families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer meet us . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself falling from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the dec@@ eased - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison with Tru@@ mp were indeed a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally sound to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ating music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , because here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &apos; experience &apos; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities . &quot;
&quot; on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder as an appeal to prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to apply this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ative Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no capital punishment in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the districts were released from F@@ use and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen into the holiday and secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students are going to school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 pupils of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle to grow up in the chi@@ ckens yard , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical titled &quot; The Eagle in the hen &apos;s Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it br@@ ittle it from his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
instead of a chicken @-@ chicken a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken broke , the eagle disper@@ sed his wings on a high mountain and sw@@ elled . &quot;
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ lei@@ gh Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young may be different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but one belongs to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ door @-@ äss@@ ler that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; they followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who always jumps back to teaching staff , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cu@@ cum@@ ber @-@ time is over now , explained school teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only dis@@ lets her students , as it has been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the neighbor@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer and holiday periods . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight first K@@ äss@@ ler have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police arrested a group of illegal refugees , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel cars : what those affected have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; in the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emissions behaviour of the emissions categories Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE car club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the negotiated software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the next few months , but no exact date . &quot;
Daimler has informed every person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fitting be drawn up in total ?
&quot; heavy to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the hang@@ ings depend on the dedication of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE tells us to wait .
&quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive drop in price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
&quot; in rural areas , there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and participate in the presentation together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the award winner Le@@ ar , which was announced with progressive TV series , has already announced to refrain from participating in the gala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tru@@ mp to make clear her view .
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; among the former winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Builder , goes to R@@ ente next year . &quot;
&quot; however , the place is already written - suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city builder . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he arran@@ ges in the press talk .
&quot; he reports from diverse , but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprised that up to now no application has received the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer for the next possible time .
&quot; in this way , considering the regular notice period , it should still be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a lower administration authority for the administrative community , the applicant must show corresponding degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be possible to fill it out , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but the clos@@ eness to the citizens is the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot are encountered . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will be be@@ ech@@ ed with some 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; If we do it correctly , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is great room for a city master builder . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dening , much can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ator Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city builder carries great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything is over my table . &quot;
&quot; with support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor stays long , W@@ acker hopes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and staying with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere but also for the further development of the city .
&quot; according to the city of Has@@ lach , those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed academic degree as a graduate engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in the field of architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt includes high@@ - and civil engineering , construction planning , construction planning , real estate affairs , administration of municipal property , urban farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dening as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : south railway line locked
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike onto the lines in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and look for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , witnesses had been observed by witnesses of a rose sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a region of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ator , would have put himself in great danger and also end@@ angers the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , also P@@ ön@@ s of the railway customers could come to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were repaired on Friday after@@ no@@ ons , rail traffic on the south railway line could be managed without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were dropped on Friday , two of which were concerned about the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the person concerned is usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
cells capable of dis@@ solving inflamm@@ ations are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promotes immune cell in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han will promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ l@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was not accommodated separately , had not . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal flora of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them in mice failed . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that a intestinal bacter@@ ium was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system , the researchers caused L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells like mice and that most of us could protect L. Cross in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. Cross . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Sig@@ nature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira inv@@ aded at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic , however , had been expelled from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and only lasted 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the premi@@ er league season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ and and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle to Washington state , but drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved into the shape of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
&quot; on the radar screens , the shape of a dre@@ am@@ liner was to be . &quot;
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire @-@ fire from the party headquarters , merely no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from Willy Brandt &apos;s House with a growing horror watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the contrary wind .
there were grav@@ estones .
and one after the other .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising Group of S &amp; D Euro MPs threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to give her mandate back .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return to her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and Ele@@ ction Manager of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; all this must not be true , &quot; an SPD bal@@ lot si@@ ghs when the new ob@@ scene message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing on the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the transition of the green depu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at his time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was the case , and everything was much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the deaf , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks thereafter , comrades , the comrades pain@@ stak@@ ingly picked up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next crash .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he did everything wrong after that , which could be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Weil .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony prime minister has been in criticism for quite some time . &quot;
the survey results were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe because of that , because in the past few weeks , because in the last few weeks , Weil tried to emphas@@ ise acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment . &quot;
they let him grant him as they spoke of Weil a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite might occur . &quot;
&quot; because of this , because of the parti@@ san force of the Lower Saxony , there is no fault . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; in the meantime , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Ms. T@@ v@@ ests presents her own career opportunities on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Head of the Party Left Party in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ v@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person , but has also been elected to parliament on the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , the Lower Saxon member . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate , four years ago , was clear : people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U members fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he demanded to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for local politicians III
those who want to renov@@ ate his home in the years can soon get support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg city development informed about this on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened before .
since 1991 there are in sensi@@ cal rehabilitation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , we received the information from the Bureau of the Regional Council of Karlsruhe that there will be a modernis@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the congregation felt . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area develop now ?
&quot; so Sch@@ ind@@ ler will continue to investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned territory there is any interest to san@@ iti@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area borders could then be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the St@@ eg represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; program , which would then be carried out as part of the renovation . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , i.e. per plot . &quot;
&quot; finally , the rehabilitation area would eventually be set as a statute . &quot;
the funding period for the funding is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order must be carried out as soon as possible , so that the rehabilitation can begin next year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commune must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
it is about evaluating and deciding on the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances when it is san@@ iti@@ zed and in what extent .
&quot; for the respective property , there will be a re@@ organisation in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to his own feelings and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that the project was an essential success factor for the project .
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent post@@ ally to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer vacation .
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and real estate &quot; , &quot; where it is about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; information on the size , layout and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operation bow &quot; is only to be filled if premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , at the same time , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of subsidies after the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes . &quot;
one cannot reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; local kern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or himself uses a micro@@ chip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a micro@@ chip im@@ planted in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the information provided by the military , which was left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , the helicopter made from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the recordings of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
&quot; from the recordings provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event might viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of the reform of health reform in the Senate and propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation when the presidential plane was in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ants frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end U.S. pres@@ idents in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire car . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representative of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky task
top riders of the Second Tennis League join the Tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable , the top rider of the Second Tennis League has got the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; especially on the post@@ erior positions , I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north are concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us as ever . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the N@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; the winner of the competition in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , will play at the end of the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first time in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo yesterday was with the White @-@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski even at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories against the Club at the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the Congress drew a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he judged . &quot;

Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the Hit@@ tite of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the ech@@ el@@ ons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise , &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1 September .
role backward : the city has 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban day care centres the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the house , a Cater@@ pillar takes over this task and supplies fresh energy . &quot;
&quot; in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ ten year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay till 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 portions of the meals are served from the 1st September kitchen service : they heat the supplied dishes , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , propor@@ tioning the meal individually , giving out food , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seven @-@ row units - decide on the scope of the ho@@ ur@@ ly .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
because it &apos;s also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the meal .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - is to be done by special cleaning staff .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power also has the charm that it has proved to be the cost comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ression and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , it is said from the Press Office . &quot;
and that although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 people in the educational field , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president , and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
Taliban have published threats against a choice process which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ on said that a strong role for women will enhance the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl .
&quot; according to the police information , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who held up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 a.m. , because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , but failed . &quot;
without prey the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s bis@@ cuit manufacturer has a long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request to express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on local community and large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , as we value the continuous commitment to employees and union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , we continuously review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and entirely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona be warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main is not following N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and to the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans board to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G middle fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G clearly made it impossible for the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter is kno@@ cked and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has pur@@ posed a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the estate number 30 on purpose and thus caused damage of more than 200 Euros in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car met him in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the console . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was driving on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car met him in his lane , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the Leit@@ plann@@ er . &quot;
in the car there was material damage .
&quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
it may be good according to the accident damage that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the judge &apos;s vehicle to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; critici@@ zed the fact that in reporting about violence in the domains , &quot; two measures &quot; were measured . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one dou@@ b@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis also said : &quot; you like to go to the church and that is a folded fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; put@@ ts have been a quite normal educational tool , &quot; to cope with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of the mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the reminder &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ? Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ esti@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that by domain master R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially at high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other accused , however , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence exercise at shel@@ ters at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; presents a contradictory image of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students raise his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a dom@@ inions didn &apos;t perform a top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you do the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger can be found in it . &quot;
he is especially dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also ex@@ propri@@ ated themselves outside their sphere of sphere .
&quot; at best , one can pre@@ tend to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all the respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presented a very excellent testimony , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority is compla@@ ining about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to sudden out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for many years , but he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to its hon@@ our@@ able salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , it is ad@@ mitt@@ edly dre@@ ad@@ ful . &quot;
one wonders if it is not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media just fell on him .
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot of abuse was reported on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s final report also put on some involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : distinc@@ tly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said an affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even entr@@ ust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ator professionally . &quot;
how do we rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after student put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben are more urgent or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ories , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any kind of compassion . &quot;
so he cannot be accused of not preventing him or being brought to the display .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violence of violence &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of taking a look at the &quot; Weg@@ visor . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is then separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the domains , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , let &apos;s say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly har@@ assed and mal@@ igned , all of them suffered from the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this was , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme of &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the reproach to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently break the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , in the previous school , the punishment would continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was clear , as test pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us knows well . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might exagger@@ ate or dramati@@ ze , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot;
this just isn &apos;t right .
only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; so the danger to evaluate the past according to the present moral standards . &quot;
the princess is quite right .
&quot; but this is not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous at all times , and not for what was banned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent chil@@ dr@@ ens . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , in other words , cat@@ tery and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he was also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
which picture from his Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the issue of exam@@ in@@ ers also become a language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not conc@@ eal that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to go on tour in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
&quot; as for a person , have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of which one cannot imagine that he could even do something . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with him , how many ex @-@ cats still today , 23 years after his em@@ itting , visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not forgiven him until today , that he once was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the domains are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them close to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which she still sees and ad@@ ore her . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you submit to it are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most unfair , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand @-@ up would be , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
