<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel where now it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows who had to be exciting already because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a flickish carpet that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large oversight map, more detailed maps, called uranium leaves, were incorporated into the cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"after all, when the French troops stripped off with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian Surveying Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The document for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming a small card appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-in numbered flurpieces from the so-called" "urine" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"today, small plots prove no more farmers, but small gardeners of the plant" Land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810, the scene of the October festival, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment leaf, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "at guest eig" "or" "Auf der Lüft-" "- but also in big letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "was established."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought to King Ludwig II's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the accusation of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also forbids the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first room, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is located in the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in architectural acclaim to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "Main Square" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The allies of the Allies seized many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel dating back to the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention, as a number of questionable, rapid-based incidents occur throughout the state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who disproportionate minority interests, led the group to release the warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed out a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office where it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be willing to bring money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which accrued the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to acclaim a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had passed immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling according to the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Turnout project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher pasture fence project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of the German parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider.</seg>
<seg id="71">"at first Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his operations, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday resorts."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest Milk" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also chairman of the fishing village BLHV, he described the turnout project as" "elementary". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot create profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"grassland care for a lot of work, much needs to be worked with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the parental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not lead to biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader-promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that this way the afforestation of the surfaces could be dragged down for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to keep their business going," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the storage area is therefore 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of €71 500, half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 km of grazing fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you're doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiß stood firm: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape care policy (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of grazing fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The pre-requisite is the presence of a conveyor system designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fence may not be ineffective (Hangnment exceeds 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fishermen's Weitling project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans cherish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue herself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have mastered it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he dealt with their importance, and in particular the significance which you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta said," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who desire to breathe freely, and the poor waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "ending waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trump USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a high political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was meant to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus was changing this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself another name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus altered the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not call anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, that puts the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty continues. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not meant to illuminate the road to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is wholly and at all a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, eleventful, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on ships of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch will not light the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics athletics, Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship negotiator will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner of the street.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was unbelievable," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with her fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the UK team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Schottlands's best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"the Muir, the middle-distance runner, leads on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also at medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">"block Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office, if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters"</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked in the criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said," "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep for slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair loose head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is paid officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not professed."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other latest news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are rather disregarded as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's staff referred to as" "focused spam-attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lead articles or arrest demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that exactly happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County rejected the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, were overwhelmed by the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former Europeans n ° 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who led the Archerfield links up to the final round last year, before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>

<seg id="214">"the Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"this really feels particularly true," said the player based in Southport. "</seg>
<seg id="216">I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them.</seg>

<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man of Helensburgh. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm happy about how it went so far.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNantes."</seg>

<seg id="233">Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoking a year," said Heiko Becher. "</seg>

<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM guides come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>

<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">"the little rice, sold in red-red, is too expensive for locals."</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of range.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire has arrived in greater numbers."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and prosperous migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">"in addition, Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete in their own businesses."</seg>

<seg id="365">"beyond that, restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escuda and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, even though they were given rare permission to film."</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers to foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa-denial and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">The lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomonen Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua including the Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically endorsed the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" "Indonesia is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human right ambassador, Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited her silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua states that they will probably not be right again for Jokowi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the Chairman of the tribal Council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of predatory military, is in poor education and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" "blame" "that he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victims led a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know they might never come to justice, but at least they don't forget their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk will reveal another, less brilliant figure for the first time at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning."</seg>
<seg id="425">"now, Musk admits that 63,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"in case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds)" Reservation Payment. ""</seg>
<seg id="428">"currently 45,000 of such non-binding reservations are available, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts."</seg>

<seg id="435">"who orders a" Model 3 "today must expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new, yet never tested production lines with maximum occupancy."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his prior position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is a deadline, which ran on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for the down-down ozone."</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hinder economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly attempted to block or delay regulators, which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Pruitts Regular rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane gas."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversing in ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often kept the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job. "</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumble celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">"750 Years St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16th at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumbling to their request.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in the year 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergisches certificate of documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumble along with the Abbey of Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document according to the documents, on the Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard to which the church or patronage belonged and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Freudenstadt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still recognizable today in the townscape of Tumble, the" "mountain" "of the third, the magnificent settlement of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval village law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was associated with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were plastered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower could be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Years Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">"only the tower, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness of the 750 year old church history."</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and promoters of Tumbling on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is at 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">"for the serenity of the Serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers provide fantastic views. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant which is of significance for Tumour and Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">Friends and promoters of Tumblgens are particularly committed to their home care as Serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to check approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim denied" "does not foresee a legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the association" "Boisheim denied" "was invited by Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette, no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent a "savings" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a form defect."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirement, the granted allowance is still unlawful and therefore to take back," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette before the summer break, a permit from the District government still stands out."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "in doing so, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out by law."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding writings have been received by the Circle of Viersen since last week," said a spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle makes it an occasion to reconsider the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four hundred metres high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of about 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-person households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district."</seg>

<seg id="533">The commercial association and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">"as the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the" home shopping "weekend will sensitize customers to which offers the own city has in store away from the usual supermarket goods."</seg>
<seg id="535">"therefore, a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is planned."</seg>
<seg id="536">"in addition, local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeships."</seg>

<seg id="542">"this includes new offers such as the first" active day "to the well-known well-selling Sunday, talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them to active participation."</seg>

<seg id="551">"the day should" promote "the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common welfare of our cities," "says Streich."</seg>

<seg id="572">"a 1948-1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford Bridge of Moore."</seg>
<seg id="573">"before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with rifles to block their way."</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a conifer-suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="575">Indoors the inmates were floating in fear.</seg>
<seg id="576">"we want this n ---- r Roger!" the man roared.</seg>
<seg id="577">"get him out of the car!" ""</seg>
<seg id="578">Screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled apart from the passenger's seat.</seg>
<seg id="579">"fortunately, this terrible scene was played on July 22, only one post."</seg>
<seg id="580">"but when a loop is thrown around the neck of" "Roger", "almost everyone in the audience hit very real sighs."</seg>
<seg id="581">Since 2005 civil rights activists come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="582">No one ever was accused of murder.</seg>
<seg id="583">"it is really inconceivable that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who assists in the organisation of the post-ordination. "</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">"Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia, and a life-long civil law firm."</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the post-position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected."</seg>
<seg id="587">"we want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="588">We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.</seg>
<seg id="589">A court physician specifies a sheet about the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynch on 27 July 1946.</seg>
<seg id="590">"according to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one ever was accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain on the ground for decades, citizen rights say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>
<seg id="593">"in April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote in Georgia for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="594">"approximately at the same time as the choice stach according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom a white land owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman."</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said the rumour in the city had been that Hester slept with Malcoms Mrs. Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not stem from her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">"on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white country owner, paid $600 to deliver Malcom from prison, the FBI."</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="598">"but when they came from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car."</seg>
<seg id="599">"as it turns out, Harrison, who has prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report. "</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the killings, eliminating the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks puts it even more concise.</seg>
<seg id="602">"it was an electoral law massacre," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="603">"they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" "if you register and if you vote, this will happen here."</seg>
<seg id="604">"for almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has conducted the annual production of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde."</seg>
<seg id="605">"their representation is vividly, poignant, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, of which many believe that he no longer exists in America."</seg>
<seg id="606">"it's hard to watch, and more difficult to look away, but Greene said that is the point."</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynch because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I have done through.</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors joined forces - a dozen whites and the rest of black - in a room and louder, as Greene started a well-coordinated overview of the piece."</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a Greene Co-director here.</seg>
<seg id="611">"he has played the role of boss clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier."</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I'm not so," "said Marbaugh."</seg>
<seg id="613">But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times.</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room, the actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines."</seg>
<seg id="615">"the piece starts with Malcom, the Hester cries out and harassed him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said, --- he, waving from my property!"</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona replies the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone breaks (at least all black actors) in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona. "</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," Greene said, still chiching. "</seg>
<seg id="625">I just don't think white people then 'n --- he' said.</seg>
<seg id="626">"but," "one of the other black actors."</seg>
<seg id="627">"you only have to hit the hard 'R.'."</seg>
<seg id="628">"and exactly there the energy shifts in space, a sense of companionship replaces the discomfort."</seg>
<seg id="629">"everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people."</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and with imprint."</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition is violent and fast.</seg>
<seg id="634">"there are cries, shots and then silence."</seg>
<seg id="635">"a woman clothed with a dress of sadness, stands above the corpses of the actor and performs Billie Holidays in the sadness of" Strange Fruit. ""</seg>
<seg id="636">Your voice breaks with every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wiped sweat and tears from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">"a couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down only the street."</seg>
<seg id="640">They all experienced Georgias's oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">"up to this point the murders have remained anecdote, but now when one stands on the same country where the Lynch Morde took place, the air feels spooky."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock at their heads, record the fake blood and the quiet body and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," "mumbles a little boy, as if he wanted to remember."</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanks Greene - and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.</seg>
<seg id="647">"Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh, the man in the suit, who played the clan member."</seg>
<seg id="648">"Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him."</seg>
<seg id="649">"it's okay," "one of the women whispers."</seg>
<seg id="650">We know that this is not in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="651">You have done that for a reason. "</seg>
<seg id="652">Later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner.</seg>
<seg id="653">"at one table, a white couple from Atlanta talking about the reproduction with a black couple that they just got to know."</seg>
<seg id="654">Denise Duplinsky was struggling to find words which felt the performance.</seg>
<seg id="655">"it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and who do it, because they look like you," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="656">"what really does with me makes me believe that the Lynch continues to go on," she added, "today it is called the police-shooting."</seg>
<seg id="657">"in the same room, Tyrone Brooks is holding his yard at his table, he eats and remembers the civil rights."</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he started planning the performance next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the post-ordination is inspiring in a certain way, as it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="660">"it is so, if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again."</seg>

<seg id="674">"there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in leaner leisure wear."</seg>
<seg id="675">The performance was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team of directors.</seg>

<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living area of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the council are hovering to foresee such a common room not as a meeting point only for residents of the living, but open to the community."</seg>

<seg id="756">The decision taken by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn by means of funding.</seg>

<seg id="758">"the establishment of a common room would be, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible."</seg>

<seg id="760">"needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer says that this is the addition."</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: it is unanimous that it happens to the body.</seg>

<seg id="763">"Daniela's reputation refers to the many of her own buildings, with which you can't advance so much, but now you lean on the common room out of the window, she says:" "I'm struggling with that."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is absolutely interested in the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, as with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus, but will receive a real counter-value in the case of doubt, the counter-speech."</seg>

<seg id="805">The information on the tables should be complemented by Internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing the location."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the StarPath train is to be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the starpath the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association. "</seg>

<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we have to fit better in Aue," says the defenders of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>

<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three-chain after the experience in preparation with the three-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have just in the three-position in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are even better harmonizing and we don't afford so many aberrations in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can talk about a misguided start, don't know."</seg>

<seg id="873">"but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start of the season."</seg>

<seg id="875">"at the start of the season, I only judged after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to a storm. "</seg>

<seg id="877">"but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"indeed, guests from the Rhineland are the easier favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away, just because we have the right to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="887">"to date, Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was" possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, during X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists was also criticized in some areas."</seg>

<seg id="901">"however, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is minimal. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the guiding organisation which monitors the European game has the power to forbid teams of access to the prestigious champion League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"with security, PSG can easily make the money loose, so Neymar has signed and put it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they have to counter with legitimate income sources that enable them to break even the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had lost enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively deceive and risked when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder affair."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current 3-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of €30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, making the revenues for the next five years worth 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs to try to revise their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come over payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar World Cup ambassadors are becoming and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could simply be figuring out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will still be more attentive to observe any attempt to bypass the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, announcing on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring dealers, merchandising and jersey purchases."</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent reminders."</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart."</seg>
<seg id="1213">"at the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">"with the same raids in Italy, two people were arrested."</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>

<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">"in total, more than 300 policemen were employed."</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the Mafia's members are accused of criminality, violent acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been established against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>

<seg id="1229">"according to a media report, the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the country-country registry."</seg>
<seg id="1230">"deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to partly serious misdecisions in the case of asylum procedures and deportations," warned in an analysis called the "Süddeutsche Zeitung." "</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to figures, ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the register, including 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data were not sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"in individual cases data had been found in 1921," of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register. "</seg>
<seg id="1235">"incorrect data input can significantly slow reversal processes," says the report. "</seg>
<seg id="1236">"in the statistics of sufficient people, EU citizens are also included, who would not have to travel at all."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"however, such false attributions led" to a distorted debate on the handling of sufficient taxpayers, "it says in the analysis."</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government has obviously begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they have arrived from there."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it provided interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the Bank's political decision makers (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members reaching an increase in this month, because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and by 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on the domestic income would continue, while inflation is likely to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to restrain the inflation heated by the Brexit and said that loan costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut's economic stimulus package, which was issued a year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for financing to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" "in the central prognosis of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">They reiterated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a "somewhat greater" degree than the markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that enhancements would be" step-by-step "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">"the Bank's growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%, compared with the forecast predicted in May."</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations on interest increase, and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% rose to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and minor salaries, as the tightening will be worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot" "prevent the incomes break" "over the next few years, but she added that wages for the end of their three-year forecast will be" "clear". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes after a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote caused by the fall of the sound.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates rose, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation declined from 2.9% last month to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the exceedance in relation to its target of 2% would be "wholly" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders would like to search for shops and end the year in a positive way."</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing Deals run out and the new mortgages take out, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (The National Health Service) should prescribe 10,000 people controversial HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the medicine at NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-position prophylactic prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register people and further clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV-drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in cases of infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in hospitals, suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a GP can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer of NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted to needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep-test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the ending of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," said Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the pretext.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"not only was it possible to build a simple platform, but put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine level, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"mirrors play a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counter-important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important but they do not play with your heart.</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">"two brothers have four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over 500 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>

<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - written by Paul as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record says that this means that Colin owns property of $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, ruled him out."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the quarrel."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy-bars and delicacies from the late 1950-s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television last decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of places that were too convincing," "said former election adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite to Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election officials in it, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit has ever been under control, is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his associates managed to keep him away from him for a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from provoking trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors, the president for strategic reasons doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he stiffens to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody said malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," being the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for schiikanen, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked her."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulse self, and his consultants are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1432">"angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said it is" useless to deal with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous resident said: "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath where they threw stones onto the passers-by.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is built from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Entreprengesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time of the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building construction containers since a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "very bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"you don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause he already led, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"after the amount of investment needed, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which is accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Issuer sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee wrote the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, relying on the subject familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper wrote the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcasted that there were already first discharges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to specifically intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as adviser of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trump private and business environment under scrutiny."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderkommando Trump had personally moved to the centre and underwent the accusation whether the president may hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime incidents and decide whether to apply charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called accusations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with major and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people to interrogate under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to CNN, demonstrations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"those who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner were also involved in the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the set-up show that Mueller does not want to intimidate himself in his work, and that if it should be necessary, act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme gives the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he didn't know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but these work normally in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI boss James Comey said three times that I will not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed in it, it was said in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump have become noisy, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June of a Senate committee, Trump asked him about an attitude of the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure due to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special promoter of the Congress, as in the Watergate affair about the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"on Thursday, two groups of republican and democratic senators presented the draft bill, after which the Sonderkommando could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has dissolved the Schelfeira."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the giant Koloss, which weighs 1,5800 square kilometres, is driving north and will probably take two, three years until it has melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"as far as climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, research data is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice valves in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken chossus has been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by great glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the north of this hill, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"AWI researcher, Daniela Jansen, writes a complete Schelfeis there."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never been so far withdrawn as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the chime leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest scarf of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the polar sign now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most weighty withdrawal since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeira will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not lead to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg not on climate change, many ice-tufts of the Antarctic peninsula are crumbling over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the polar area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature increased.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore counts to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants a hourly rate in personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU asks from the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"just before the summer break, 41 new positions in the administration instinct."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 apprentices have completed their first day of work."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very popular.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 non-occupied places at the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate internally and externally, to show concrete measures for Quereinsteiger and include a training campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"so, the highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter's peoples, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was already worried about a fist big surprise when he questioned the personnel costs and bewildered the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed to allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county government should strive with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a hourly rate," "said peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually envisages the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrant lifeboats</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself in the allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a position on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised, after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that his crew takes dinghy immigrants aboard, which will be delivered directly from traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be re-used."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as Iuventra must first have an Italian police officer who supervised their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the Minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest von Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim on hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, lookout lookout at the lookout point, connected by" flowerage "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters were announced again."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks."</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, the sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium racing at wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long been a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges."</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal government agencies that are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning made 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took under contract two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">He is sure that there are several clubs on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London hosted the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>

<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be much more present on these markets online than once a year to send the Federal Government to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"during e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or just football simulation FIFA will play on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in the normal sport, Ligen has long established itself in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and with the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the performance is certainly getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobat has dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses, which are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the custom player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but Frobat also sees problems:" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"in online games, inspections are difficult to perform, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the road internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in the E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales should lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte consultants. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">"internationally, many countries are already moving forward."</seg>
<seg id="1647">"big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football league clubs are now obliged to set up an E-Sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany is leaving behind", "explains VfB-President Röttgermann."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia to decay, and to elucidate the ancient times is no longer sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time on the modern market."</seg>

<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have changed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>

<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no regret." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she deplored.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that" there is no day in which I am not betting the loss of my beloved Son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, despite all my pain we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters." "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be an ante for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not to have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I'll keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, arise yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," "she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the eyes of his suicide she wrote," You must do, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was paid by Roy's death and ordered that it should benefit from any press from the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder at her British roommate in Italy, before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1695">"well, the entry could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>

<seg id="1698">Sugar is best distributed to those you want to have a lot to keep in your mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who have been chosen to embark on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimmir affirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>

<seg id="1702">"to the right rear, this is now his position, the white binder in the arm did its rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and in general, Kimmir made me feel like the one who is best able to take the helm."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to steer the unrehearsed troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal therefore, to overplay his missing fitness (barely collapsed); Renato Sanches thus, on the devil, come out of the accomplishments of the Asia trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle do not have a negative impact on their first appearance in the Bayern Tricot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">At least it worked very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran beside Kimi, Rudy in front of the defense, both operated confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the recently occupied Napoli storm was very heavy, and addicted to the game building a couple of times."</seg>

<seg id="1713">"as usual, this Bayern-world is still for the newcomers, one saw in the connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"Kimi said goodbye to his new players, after a few clue statements."</seg>

<seg id="1729">"Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer (VTU), says," Wisser attacks the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked. "</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest reversal is Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now up to the top in the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 will be the building law."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the Westumigung Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Ministry of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the objective is to put the track in operation in December 2020, says Ministerial spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees in it a sign for regional, but internationally competing companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (Chamber of Industry and Industry of Trier) strives, as is suggested by Wisser, a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports losing 10 years."</seg>

<seg id="1752">"the BMW Chairman said that" there are smarter options as driving restrictions, "and thus attracted European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"but nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of automakers, systems for neutralising the exhaust gases ejected by diesel vehicles, also contribute to what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of brewing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested by Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italians and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.

<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and feelings are sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected to stand on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while all the country houses the corpses, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has held his office in December 2012, there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are their editors and their creator of Rioce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamericana."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special public prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Rioce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everybody."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rioce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "twelfth river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to say about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornamented, two-storey mausoleums for drug-kings, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have angered the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force Valdez, after confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country at its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to establish Rioce and sold 50 US dollar holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Rioce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever she led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird that could fly like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love for the routine be his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the publisher of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Rioce met for safety training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed. days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who described the governor themselves as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Rioce has banded on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled by the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the staff became something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of scoring journalists and putting them around because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has been asked since then, that it is regrouped by the government because it is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book called" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the command of politicians and security forces who were involved in organised crime under a veil."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has reported more than half of the attacks against journalists from the police and civil servants last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note signed by the Tetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones lay in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain backward and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Rioce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer when all their telephones began to hug."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the board, they published the news on the website of Rioce on mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren heals nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the employees of Rioce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," Bojorquez said, "When the same day when Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight it looks like a statue, although a terrifying one."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the persistent armored dinosaur, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved state has baffled researchers, which describe it as" really remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earthclots."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivorous, even though it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counteract, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and now can be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals who use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodinosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have to have been the chalk time," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther farther than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this noodaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you are just a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when gigantic theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he founded on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the guarded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures on average were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters were swept through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the tailoring of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified vestiges of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin crates still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Blocked remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers crossed upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on its sole.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the storm: mass carambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous injured, miles long Staus and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the Stuttgart-Munich highway (A8), around 20 people were injured at a mass-carambolage on the late Thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"according to the first data of the police, around 5pm between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed into one another."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there is no information available about the exact number of injured persons."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of the city of Munich, an approximately ten kilometres long backstau was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as an AZ reporter reports, there was also on the counter-road to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade was the hallmark of the car owners who now have to reckon with delicate penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45, another second accident occurred at the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between an automobile transporter and a car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">"it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing, you sit in the train and sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes an unsuspected or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"one simply confirms by mobile phone, that you take your seat and devaluate the ticket."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available at many other remote routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said S & D spokesperson. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "is the name of the train."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to purchase it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">"last but not least, you need a seat reservation."</seg>
<seg id="2003">"the" "comfort check-in" "works like this: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customer then appears as a button for electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">The train attendant at the ticket control at Platz Y knows that there is a passenger with already devaluated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, check out the DB Navigator yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows passengers to make their travel time in a personal way," says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing manager. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who often travel, know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often you have, in any case, one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you must show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the bottoms or large room and delays in the control of their own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core."</seg>

<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assured his gun and cried," "I'm going to kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we get used to and which we can typically call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she got her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas starting at 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the vision of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, came to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had on the black experience and the black condition innumerable times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she recalled what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take form for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," "she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came into mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt's occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browning's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we're talking," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," "said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell, laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life on these junctions it is a black gay woman so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels obliged to remember this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the Bit-Galerie moves the people, even though it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg", "the topic will be discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one-bit gallery would say:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "that would be real class" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "don't need a person" "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" "megalomania!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which the rest of the business will benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, the end will be the end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Galerie-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-Platz, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countrywomen are always very happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities this is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But the new project shouldn't be too low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive above all."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops are hired only by larger companies in a shopping mall, because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where is the peasant market hall planned during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit gallery previously to drive all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - as I think - meaningless building projects in Bitburg do not have any room any more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which almost resemble itself - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Secret Service Analyst banned a 35-year custodial sentence after publicly decreed diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline has united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created an algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, among them six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just returned from the great success of its 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigar dummy and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal eyewitnesses who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo's" "Suppressed Images", "which foresaw a future in which the President Chelmo would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of lucky coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump is introducing a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable paths to flaming the rigid splits that it should actually remedy."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological respect, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as she appears in the hands of a free-talk-phone in the hands of the disciplines of the United States such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they strike your speech, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacons, which converge like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haploids were written with a pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as demonstrated by Cook County's Local Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the spot, and detectives investigate the bulks as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007 Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been judged and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce", "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents:" the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident. "</seg>
<seg id="2180">"" "we will conclude the WADA driving plan in the near future" "- Russian Vice-President Mutko"</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Vice-Remier Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA driver plan was updated in this respect," "stated Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-setting RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything will be implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in regards to the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has got an error. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we won't admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the WADA by performing doping controls in Russia in November 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moves" in the right direction "to be used again."</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employee at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"and even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed. "</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it enables companies to perform surveys, provide specific groups and demographic groups, to handle employees anonymity and appeal hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowers allow the C-suite executives to handle and contact the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most discomfort and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that has been punished for those who have spoken."</seg>

<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like GLINT, Convercent companies send tailor-made" pulse "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline to report bad behaviour to employees.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion polled the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that is poorly treated or behaves ethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way of pursuing the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internship - can be identified and addressed more quickly."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"but it took until the" social media came to their right, "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online."</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"glittering secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million."</seg>

<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and motivate employees."</seg>

<seg id="2264">"this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," said Bruges-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually prolonged their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three UCLA workouts should start at 19: 15 to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the Bruges postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras carried out practical exercises in Westwood."</seg>
<seg id="2268">"in the course of August, 18 exercises are to be held. 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September."</seg>
<seg id="2269">Mora said that he supports the change of regulation of the NCAA even if they add a further point to the many busy routes of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous strain on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora. "</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they just pushed it through, they plunge, they're great people."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it's really great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"the UCLA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class, which has already been cleared with footballs, will not be an easy task."</seg>

<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library, a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "he says."</seg>

<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, to look through the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles which centuries had stayed in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscaping, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust won the full access until 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2339">So this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff, as previously, but in the office of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"under the chairmanship of the Heads of State, the five vice-ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions."</seg>

<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt, will be involved in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"even on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the overthrow of God as a" gift of God, "as he gave him the opportunity to completely cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Uncomfortable in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" "Islamisation" "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the major purthing with the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan had fired another 7395 police officers, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly regarded as the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least with calling on the European Union's reform agenda."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just when you thought it could not become even crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey at the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex-dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sextolls have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy conserved with a vibrator on his website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is said on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication point to some Dunkleres and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices its increasing popularity they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what seeps out of the edge zones can be very instructive in regards to the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is, however, a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who prays to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Maidservant ') are not the graphic images, the entwined bodies and the expelled eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the mode of speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Shrimps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US voters, have also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to let ourselves be placed in order to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed is the power of trump, families."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican kinship, with whom she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer meet us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the deceased - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison with Trump were indeed a very mild criminal offence."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally sound to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perating music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream."</seg>
<seg id="2442">"thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London."</seg>
<seg id="2443">"however, the Central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, because here two two-year-old, a 11 year old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time."</seg>
<seg id="2444">"if I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it."</seg>
<seg id="2445">"on the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my 'experience' with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card."</seg>

<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"in the diesel-summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are supposed to improve the emissions behaviour of the emissions categories Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>

<seg id="2539">"he reports from diverse, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprised that up to now no application has received the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer for the next possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, considering the regular notice period, it should still be enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts as a lower administration authority for the administrative community, the applicant must show corresponding degrees."</seg>

<seg id="2545">"if it would not be possible to fill it out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the closeness to the citizens is the city and it is important to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens."</seg>

<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is great room for a city master builder."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own building yard and gardening, much can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what fits in, "when new buildings are approved, the separator Stadtbaumeister emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the city builder carries great responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," in the end everything is over my table. "</seg>

<seg id="2563">"according to the city of Haslach, those who want to bury Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed academic degree as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in the field of architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike onto the lines in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116)."</seg>

<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the person concerned is usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of dissolving inflammations are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promotes immune cell in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tryptophan will promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowllieus, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was not accommodated separately, had not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal flora of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them in mice failed."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal bacterium was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers caused L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice and that most of us could protect L. Cross in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. Cross."</seg>

<seg id="2630">"according to the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once again: red-green can simply not rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Deutschland (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising Group of S & D Euro MPs threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the Parliament election, its red-green coalition lost its one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-German managing director Michael Kellner called on the rebellious Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Tvests to give her mandate back.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transfer to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tvests must immediately return to her mandate," "said the Federal Managing Director and Election Manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"all this must not be true," an SPD ballot sighs when the new obscene message reaches the party centre on Friday morning. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing on the CDU without his own government majority following the transition of the green deputies Elke Tvests."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miser began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>

<seg id="2643">"after the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"that was the case, and everything was much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the deaf, the Düsseldorf-Pleite hauled the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the weeks thereafter, comrades, the comrades painstakingly picked up again."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just picked up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next crash.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus on that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">"and because in crisis communication, he did everything wrong after that, which could be done wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for its political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW-exhaust-affaires and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony prime minister has been in criticism for quite some time."</seg>
<seg id="2654">The survey results were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or maybe because of that, because in the past few weeks, because in the last few weeks, Weil tried to emphasise accents."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin, too, did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz's environment."</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him as they spoke of Weil a stabilization of the party.</seg>

<seg id="2659">"because of this, because of the partisan force of the Lower Saxony, there is no fault."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"in the meantime, comrades try to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all on the rebellious parliamentarians Tvests."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is intolerable and democratic, as Ms. Tvests presents her own career opportunities on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Left Party in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Ms. Tvests has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person, but has also been elected to parliament on the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party, the Lower Saxon member."</seg>

<seg id="2666">"Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains" "undemocratic manoeuvre." ""</seg>

<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the order must be carried out as soon as possible, so that the rehabilitation can begin next year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then explained that each commune must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will again come to his own feelings and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed that the project was an essential success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore there will be questionnaires that will be sent postally to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer vacation.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and real estate", "where it is about the structural condition and the renovation views."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the information provided by the military, which was left to the TIME magazine up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"in addition to a yacht from Maine, the helicopter made from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi, the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the recordings of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event might violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "said the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for reform of the reform of health reform in the Senate and propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump carried out an investigation when the presidential plane was in front of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 occupants frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to suspend U.S. presidents in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 led 58 practice landings at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours on that day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers overtook the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to Stundentarifen of the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH 3D is 24.380 USD per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is most misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to emphasize that.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire car."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House Trump spoke to representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of the misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger, wrote the reminder" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment? Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domesticks. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in conclusion, Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that by domain master R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other accused, however, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence exercise at shelters at the Regensburger Domspatzen "presents a contradictory image of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students raise his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a dominions didn't perform a top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you do the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger can be found in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is especially dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the pre-school also expropriated themselves outside their sphere of sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can pretend to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all the respondents as" "salvation," "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presented a very excellent testimony," sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to sudden outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he was deeply regretted and apologized for many years, but he was deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to its honourable salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, it is admittedly dreadful."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot of abuse was reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger's final report also put on some involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: distinctly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother," "said an affected representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even entrust their parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we rate Ratzinger's Domspatzen student's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after student put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... Buben are more urgent or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitories, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any kind of compassion."</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of not preventing him or being brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate its good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was a lot of" "violence of violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former domain master Georg Ratzinger was accused of taking a look at the "Wegvisor."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of George Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is then separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the high school of the domains, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let's say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and maligned, all of them suffered from the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatz gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this was, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme of" "pre-school" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatz gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but there was no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims estimated the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the reproach to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently break the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that, in the previous school, the punishment would continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was clear, as test penalties were banned in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us knows well."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might exaggerate or dramatize, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This just isn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "pitfall of anachronism," "so the danger to evaluate the past according to the present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is not true for sexual abuse, which was abhorrendous at all times, and not for what was banned in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent childrens."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I'm glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, in other words, cattery and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he was also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture from his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger played in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of examiners also become a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the Domspatzen only played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to go on tour in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"as for a person, have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger quite well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of which one cannot imagine that he could even do something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with him, how many ex-cats still today, 23 years after his emitting, visit him regularly, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he once was stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domains are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them close to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which she still sees and adore her."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you submit to it are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unfair, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand-up would be, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
