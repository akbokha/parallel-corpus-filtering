J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; in an interview , this made the Hollywood star clearly unmistak@@ ably clear . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers , or I get stuck from the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather snow@@ ing me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; as a favorite , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a television with a delicious de@@ br@@ is and mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their feast , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p at home . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
&quot; he let himself be led by his family through the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even swear for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and therefore also at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help handed the man from An@@ hausen to the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid as part of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the sport pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent . &quot;
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US Master@@ Win@@ ner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; these are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ eng , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ one in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
who knows about the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep them small and warn that the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulation . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate them to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , Tru@@ mp claims . &quot;
&quot; it will massi@@ vely return regulations , and it will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has opportunities to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tru@@ mp , there could still be party @-@ internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement he wants to quit . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to explicitly strengthen and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America -- I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ i@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but just to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid even better , for example Clinton asks . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of women who escape alone almost daily .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has placed her small son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene looks normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s help . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience on her flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as the hope @-@ makers &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; many of them steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs require a sexual act for a bottle of water , is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of the women living in the apartment in the Munich North are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children were certainly not born voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying that they do not say anything .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations just for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answers some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men separately . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or the men and women are accommodated together , it can become - ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the shower rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study . &quot;
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; since we have spoken about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the assistance specialists have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment policies in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more safety measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there were ministers agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had persist@@ ently quiet &quot; problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations on all your worries . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work combat measures that begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to assistance doctors in six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Doc@@ tors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow , and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved like nothing worse . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was u@@ pro@@ oted .
Putin split and accused Ankara to fall into Russia .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; the government controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara for months . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has challenged this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he became a coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard , in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ da@@ sti stated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it considers the response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak answer .
&quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the worm emp@@ ower of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West . &quot;
the Russian Head of State won a bonus in Ankara for claiming that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and are now al@@ lied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents were saying that they had not even ri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found on Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State are talking at least once more . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
&quot; according to the Executive Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; they supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ vot@@ al headquarters and the listing on the stock market will change to Nat@@ Western . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for retail , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor @-@ brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will not be able to continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these stamps . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , bringing him 3@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ ,000 British gain at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy about the fact that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori cat@@ ches the jubil@@ ee when he wins the win on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ckey wheels reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career prospects &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone which only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a has been enthusiastic fans for this sport for many years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already won nearly 30 years of winner in the UK , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fli@@ ers and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin hum@@ idi@@ fies Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence group for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without stating &quot; reasons . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who since 2012 was Ivan@@ ovo &apos;s deputy , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was a protocol manager and Chief of Staff of the government . &quot;
he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the ridi@@ cul@@ ousness for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ? &quot;
nobody knows this at this moment .
but the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president - would once again lead Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - compla@@ ining items for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov participated in the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term coup would have viol@@ ated the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another nearby Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about 75 fish for sand@@ als that were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
business Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hot activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a g@@ ong for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high @-@ rise and civil engineering .
&quot; after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or west side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very cheerful activity .
&quot; massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an ascent of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team works , they were tiny - only a few milli@@ metres were lying on each side . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; said the leader of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &apos; rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hanging on a boom without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board the shore rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency stop , but the boat was released by the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously hurt - man stit@@ ches up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to get his personal stuff . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ sty@@ li@@ zed perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice on her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother . &quot;
she then al@@ armed her sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building profitable homes in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors are supposed to be much stronger in future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; Living concept &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to point 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be produced in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the big dispute in the town hall is , however , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing funding program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , will provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
&quot; despite this , Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not yet complete : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which were to be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do we compare the loss of further 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , as planned spokesperson Nicole Palm , the city should now be bought out@@ going b@@ ind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring flats back to price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western part of the city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
because in the western city there are periods of time at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is dr@@ astically increased , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a large majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
this has concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on star@@ ing on screens , was compla@@ ined by many in the last decade . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and getting more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters , which were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created from it ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest sun@@ k before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loads .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons , who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the car and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot;
&quot; the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the Washington Post reported that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , the number of people followed by 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data about performance enhancement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people looking el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
those who regularly engage in sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even hunt new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y players who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk around a door . &quot;
what shall it be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to poker success , there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people hunt , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on all that immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team members A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ mo@@ il on the floating beam during the individual campaign of women in the gym@@ nas@@ tics event at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title , and overall the fifth while it soli@@ di@@ fies its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected it to be a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign women of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party , the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ en insisted that during her long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was easily led by two turns , the picture dec@@ ep@@ ted . &quot;
Swedish lum@@ ber and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she resum@@ ed again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the beam - and put one on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her en@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ mans performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Mu@@ staf@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , named &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen &apos;s audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial killer shot shot in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous incident of Phoenix , while listening to the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder had not been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; overall , seven people were killed in nine attacks and two others were injured in nine attacks . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah still died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was dra@@ gged on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it will be better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; however , like the least of his anti@@ qui@@ ties , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself in .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course you have left yourself on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund could not sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but it slowly progres@@ ses .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has devised for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected with the ci@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ a@@ virus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their shores and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ all , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service made it clear that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level that was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still inflic@@ ted people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , is rising overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water war@@ med and poured in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , in which she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions .
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported about 13.@@ 75 inches of rain near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground was fully su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
&quot; the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts . &quot;
the WW@@ W C@@ BS subsidiary reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , washed up by floods . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the floo@@ ding water and sand bags for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as floo@@ ding , but no reports have been reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the waist , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital during his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; told his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy informed the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical state , reported on the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently came to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for storm rif@@ les that were traced back to different storm rif@@ les over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police , according to reports , reviewed the surveillance video . &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I present to myself at the gym@@ nasi@@ um in the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gym@@ n@@ oses , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , rounds off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female female companions was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner in the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champi@@ onships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see trainers all over the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic Games will only have four players in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like gym@@ nas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ n@@ ast in first place in private gym@@ nas@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for the training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued as desired . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ n@@ oses receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started with the gym@@ nas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the congregations au@@ n innum@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym@@ nas@@ tics training . &quot;
I founded my gym 20 years ago .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable gym@@ nas@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gym@@ nas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gym@@ nas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it &apos;s the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to care for the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team &apos;s gol@@ ds and thanks , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t has revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend endar@@ s in order to improve the maintenance of periods of time . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance Speci@@ alists shared the last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have still had serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will inc@@ ite the current occup@@ ancy crisis and it is agreed to address all doctors . &quot;
&quot; for only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through discussions strug@@ gled with the government to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened because of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made about it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants better weekly pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistants who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything but little , but already bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ stle @-@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important subjects - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , education holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after it was advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the flow of blood to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to bro@@ aden available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture boo@@ sts electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from the office due to corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les interven@@ es verb@@ ally the police , election observers and coun@@ cill@@ ors to have ignored pro@@ ofs of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ ties and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now a response king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead an ID card , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; currently , a vot@@ er must name his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he ur@@ ges that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the current mayor of Lut@@ on should be reli@@ eved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a lit@@ any . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign based on the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person el@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence throughout the country for fraud .
he expressed particularly al@@ arming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding le@@ vies to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in its report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence has been appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection documents to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider choosing options before choosing to ask for your ID .
&quot; do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible for voting .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter @-@ code .
ban that political activists work full brief@@ ing and envel@@ opes of letter elections .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off stations .
a change of legislation facilit@@ ated an accus@@ ation due to in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually enforce that voters go alone into the election cabin .
&quot; Sir Eric runs over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his representative for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ ups &quot; of the election registration departments of the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T beyond the border and band that proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ic@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ lete , fighting for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe in the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures , on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star in a very similar way . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see a big simil@@ arity , except for the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jumping Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a speed higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ tig , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alist Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von fans att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which is similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like a pig died
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds Analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m outdoor pool staff@@ ed audience of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
&quot; the Canadian transmitter C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese pool &quot; &quot; ab@@ duc@@ ted &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor pool staff@@ ing his own opinions .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went down like called M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; Chinese Schwimm@@ erin Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swim squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows at the fin@@ als 4 x 200m outdoor swimming pool for women : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which he spoke many questions . &quot;
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , was ap@@ olog@@ ising live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ happy chosen formulation , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times among the people who responded to the Twitter via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ined about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we were quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers at the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments were related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on her as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said is very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s s@@ wimm@@ ers in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a row to try to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked out as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
they continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried to get the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , with@@ drew her own stru@@ mp@@ ing trousers and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants , which they obviously did not like as they put them back into the shelf again . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything to get back and go out .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the pants she had tasted .
&quot; David Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how to re@@ think that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to draw the clothes out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and did not wash her .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approached from behind , then you should turn around as a first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the body and twist while the as@@ sail@@ ant hi@@ des in front of pain the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while putting the gun on him .
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the weapon and twist it , so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight on the gun and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the gun from his grip , before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s going to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est thing to over@@ lay your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and th@@ rot@@ tle of a serious test - by hiding some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ red his course on a Euro ticket , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a mig@@ rat@@ ory toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the empt@@ ying of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will let himself in . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the idea to lick the washing button of a mig@@ rat@@ ory toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he le@@ aned , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to railway stations to washing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set his immune system defini@@ tively below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial under@@ score showed a lumin@@ ometer number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal than that !
I will not lick here anything because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon .
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ar@@ ded some of the things I had instructed him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; social Family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation Social Ac@@ com@@ modation in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their home after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ wered employees of the housing association found the property in an irre@@ parable condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls had holes , wooden boards were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived meanwhile in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive cries , stri@@ kers and flights included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were pil@@ ed up &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the road and had to be called by the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , who said their life was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t sh@@ rie@@ ve anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
on the ramp@@ ant side of the community building waste and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , since del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti@@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the floor .
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don got a fine @-@ out after she had found herself guilty of the possession of a class B drug .
&quot; she claimed that the money for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say that they will deleg@@ ate tenants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without sel@@ ections , as well as those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal panic after a flying military jet over@@ flies
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force took an incredible storm flight
&quot; air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no safety risk . &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ pping jet crashed over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew close to the beach section of Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up as they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle , without seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers posted videos about the dramatic Fly By in social media said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast while flying so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet was somewhat lower than usual due to bad visibility due to bad visibility , but the air forces insisted that safety was not at all at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke smoke , which restric@@ ts his view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
cup : Bar@@ ca with worries against Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup out against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash goes three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ man has to renoun@@ ce the Olympic football tournament in force with the signed Cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europe @-@ League champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is also missing . &quot;
&quot; in the course of training , the German suffered a change of b@@ anding in the knee , which at least initially clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years . &quot;
&quot; so far Coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining races took the lead . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish Master has doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . Co. did not really know how to convince at 3 : 2 in the morning stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
&quot; Sev@@ ille , again , has the 2 : 3 defeat after extending the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot;
Ma Long in your own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; the World Cup winner was awarded the Golden Grand S@@ lam for World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
&quot; as expected , the two Chinese made it into the final game and made the title among themselves . &quot;
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the top Olympic bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches . &quot;
they pulled back onto the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the match up here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang rightly said . &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ al .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match did not develop . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , sufficient breath @-@ taking ball@@ ads were to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had a ri@@ pp@@ le injury in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als , after that it had to be content with tin . &quot;
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become a similar high table tennis set Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &apos; enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp announced the weaknesses of his campaign in the current Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have enormous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp said before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; due to the false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sch@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tru@@ mp and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC station , Tru@@ mp responded to the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he makes no difference to telling the truth .
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was ok , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans can be strengthened more strongly for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : third Sc@@ am of Dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud trial in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village called a Ur@@ in Trial under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker shared . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the Dop@@ ing Control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er , released and signed , &quot; declared Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become World Cup @-@ fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan light @-@ athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against money payments sports@@ men of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi Airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing failures , Kenya has been under special observation since a long time . &quot;
&quot; with the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , unusual athletes from Kenya and Russia had to be targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control conform to the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und last called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that this type of sport was cover@@ tly and systematically monitored . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were therefore excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic romantic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth mare with the role of Mary .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ steins &apos;s music really in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members with sad@@ ness to her lover with Tony while the younger sister is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli res@@ ig@@ ns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with it .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ky cans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful as they were at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London girls who joined the IS were killed in Syria
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , reported reports in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family experienced a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV News on Thursday reported . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old , and according to her family she died shortly after having left the war @-@ torn country and returned to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it to go into a war zone - people from stopping at ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London got into an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land as candidate for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presi@@ dency of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation from his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference , that he expects Clinton to select &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate a country and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys is distingu@@ ishable , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the Calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel at ease and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to release the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person with an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community calcul@@ ates mass accur@@ sed
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting tens of thousands of det@@ ain@@ ees coming from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , even &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight against the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish high bur@@ ners with criminal charges , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the icy put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or displaced over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the chief of the Federation demanded that the Federal Government re@@ positioned itself as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters .
&quot; in Germany too , a witch hunt takes place against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on figures by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already ordered the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus just under 29 per cent of all admitted to asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey there is no wage for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually followed . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; until 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; as far as so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day struggle - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up voices only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign just close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
it will be exciting to see how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Se@@ ering won &apos;t get cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is when you make election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale conferences twice ; Angela Merkel is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not right , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently at N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
&quot; apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that on the land you crum@@ ble the base that it needs to be very strict again to find a wire to the people .
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any one in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is in the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats la@@ gged down 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of their holidays and move their election campaign largely to the internet .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green elec@@ tive warri@@ ors embar@@ k on trace search for native voices among holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg L@@ akes and finds it even more beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 remedi@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5 : 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made everything very jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October . &quot;
&quot; the counter@@ parts of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again , the transport situation within the village has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now move from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen out of the B 27 on both sides .
escap@@ ing through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were partial complaints , &quot; says the deputy head director Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many det@@ ours were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks reloc@@ ated to residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exagger@@ ations , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself on the spot on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have been infl@@ amed .
the fastest one was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the road is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to revenues in sales , lets everyone look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the end customer , so for other companies , has hardly any consequences for this . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; the running history is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the restaurants along the street .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all restaurants were &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil are missing . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; sales revenues are based on &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road painting has thrown back its operations &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt stated on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where such funding has been handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ators are now less frequ@@ ented because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly screw@@ ed to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Minister of Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now laying out a thick security package . &quot;
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ver@@ ry .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable for the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not over@@ call anybody .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; as Minister of the Interior , however , he was on the basis of results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gave a little time to submit before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; some are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and tru@@ ce rights .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship from the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot;
&quot; he still holds this for reasonable and does not demand anything , which is not a chance for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ eer anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
these are partly in themselves : he plans quick @-@ procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aching people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of D@@ ul@@ sions for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to obsc@@ ure their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some are still un@@ affected and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated ones for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee numbers . &quot;
and things that people deeply occupied were not cl@@ inging out even in election campaign times .
the inner security is enormously focused .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are increasingly turning into position . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ er argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department heads also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a departure from the double nationality . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles for reconc@@ iling sounds .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double pass , he keeps nothing . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; to re@@ discover , don &apos;t make sense . &quot;
&quot; and with a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , it must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could cause quar@@ rels .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to benefit from inner security . &quot;
&quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes the willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still going to get off lightly .
&quot; despite the diesel scale , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not in all markets . &quot;
&quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start in the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car will continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , VW &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as stated in the Da@@ x company . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
deliveries by almost one sixth in the home market in Germany declined .
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of market sales , brought back the weaker figures from July above all to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was bur@@ dened by the EU to exit the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the exhaust gas is first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the primarily affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is further off lightly due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an emission of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is be@@ ech . &quot;
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales figure from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen was manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust test .
&quot; in Germany alone , Volkswagen inv@@ okes about 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after ref@@ itting the car , the car hire a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is legal details .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee of modified diesel models .
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA fully .
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion , no deterior@@ ations take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen will be able to see that customers for example come into a workshop six months after the conversion - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the interests of customers , it is important to avoid that in any other damages which have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , a uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations comes as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not . &quot;
&quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich savers in the future , as a second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent of the penalty . &quot;
&quot; this charge applies to the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time he covered 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and which he could not evaluate . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4,000 euros . &quot;
the costs are now on hand according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle .
&quot; leaving the cash just in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Bank Council . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to carry you alone , &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically is not possible permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have raised their charges for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pun@@ ishments for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private customers to pay for deposits on deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; , &quot; which calculate a charge for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to Neg@@ ative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to compete . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be satisfied with this in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
solitary middle @-@ aged men love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section , to om@@ it it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ ele men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ formation of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able group of buyers . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers are more likely to retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffy before I stop , hold my hands and say something special : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - still a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men of middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men of middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought objects he sold when he was young and broken .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media track , people who heard about the com@@ eback and were forced to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of adher@@ ents to the rec@@ ess of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of familiar sound plates , of objects , the happy adjusting entries . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to get involved mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a record stack . &quot;
an IC@@ M survey revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t own record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I fl@@ atten out a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ ellas comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ class . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only come in slowly . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ p , dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast &apos;s latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ be@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot;
it is more like a shopping spre@@ ader than buying a big shopping mall .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives off with a loved si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the appearance to brave jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras , before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley plate player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research finds that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they can be considered , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not by stro@@ lling through sheet @-@ shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ chy view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who ra@@ ges over the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and which hold a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely nour@@ ishing people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the down@@ fall was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the jungle @-@ bearing rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympics disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic period , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get down . &quot;
&quot; I keep in mind the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to say that it &apos;s hard to comment yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyze in silence what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time driving World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed at the last time .
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time World Champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at the Olympic champion , Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

group increases in start @-@ up for live video games
&quot; watching other people watching video games is a huge escape , from which Microsoft also wants to benefit . &quot;
the technology group bu@@ ys the startup Be@@ am speci@@ alizing in this hobby .
Microsoft didn &apos;t share how much money flows for the acquisition .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and has already more than 100.000 users .
&quot; you can look at others while playing , but also interven@@ ing yourself . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can abandon the players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot;
the Spiel@@ eri@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
&quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help . &quot;

&quot; the staff of the start @-@ up , based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in the California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced . &quot;
the acquisition will therefore not change anything for the customer .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the X@@ box console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was bought from Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance at sever@@ ity points , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary heating systems , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot;
the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measurement mode and the case data is transmitted encrypted using a modem .
&quot; with laser technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits and access prohibited by time , route and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved by car with a trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also fire@@ proof outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested in various federal states according to Vit@@ ronic , and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after fet@@ ched Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side qu@@ il@@ ting , back @-@ back , line run , and raw power to win gold - her first Olympi@@ am@@ e@@ da@@ ille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ pt by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the big defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game of the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they just lost one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started amaz@@ ingly and had fun off the attacks of G@@ Bs .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , as if you were running in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a terri@@ fic t@@ ack of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to reach a third goal but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a Touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ whi@@ stle and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u presses further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still growing . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ an , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced themselves and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ ushing into the lawn . &quot;
in the past Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eric gold than with these games and that will be what is called .
&quot; from the first stroke down to the last 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of trium@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and it was no more assistant than the coach who did not know whether to survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and that they did .
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could start treatment early 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances the right concept is at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing on itself is a challenge , but it makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ provo@@ king morning to talk more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked for .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to lock up , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be torn .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water condu@@ it for the large water producers .
this was the reason for some time ago in the original edition of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken s@@ worn the purpose . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern @-@ far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the Association for 31 years , stood as Managing Director for 28 years . &quot;
he was then retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes around 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
water supply contracts are available for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from the construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency assignments at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , real estate purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the replacement of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always resum@@ ed new developments because water spo@@ ils life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part praised the Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ building and re @-@ structuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high hop@@ per at Kirch@@ ner on a third of January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained once only because one filled the high hop@@ pers of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who replaces Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed she must die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well forward and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots to life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 a.m. and wounded them to death .
&quot; the man himself called upon us and stated to have shot his companion , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police has published a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
he who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in Lü@@ beck , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the ta@@ xing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but it confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special task command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens threatened by the sector from green electricity extraction are from the table .
&quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es environment in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on electricity production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed . &quot;
special significance is the success of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; in view of our campaign &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emissions trading segment , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation escal@@ ated further than the world &apos;s largest producer in China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies prize dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties on import steel show effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up . &quot;
it is unclear how long the price will be picked up .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been rather stagn@@ ant . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; at last , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to each other for the second month . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production grew by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
the association anticip@@ ates a rising output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing do@@ ves sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp &apos;s whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt he studied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ oren@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes . &quot;
&quot; through regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to talk and organize , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs get out of the d@@ olls even in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Seni@@ oren @-@ Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , collective singing had a much higher significance ; it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , explains them . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through song lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ infected people det@@ ain from long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in addition , singing will also demand a special achievement , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm , and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people who live alone , exercise not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir too .
&quot; to show itself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and more vig@@ il@@ ant about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; one does not sing alone - for 50 singing people , who hears there when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &apos; choir , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research . &quot;

cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on the cries of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover the effect the throwing of cat babies on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ ch@@ ew did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved immediately in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to lau@@ rels of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited juven@@ iles are either not percep@@ tible or not important for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens write with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were pre @-@ played for a rowing of little ones , taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens that were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off . &quot;
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop@@ mental with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;

Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , a major football match will be held in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch @-@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even with the exception of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it is not possible to stop football before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to this , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ßer was supposed to be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , most Turks have no impact on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the night @-@ time &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan finished on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into pend@@ ants and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas do not traditionally count among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the Great &apos;s anger is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &apos;s &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially coming back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with 17 fo@@ ols and nine designs in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Pre @-@ Round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , only rank six was enough . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year of the game was better .
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season winners as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que King . &quot;
this is also the reason why the fans hope to return to the 31 year old .
&quot; the Gom@@ ez , which came under contract at AC Florence , and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , had only announced , after the coup attempt , not to return due to the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the Stür@@ mer must be willing to renoun@@ ce approximately one @-@ third of its estimated 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay its salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other exagger@@ ated athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian swimming pool Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined about a dop@@ ing @-@ lock in front of the games after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock , became mer@@ cil@@ essly whi@@ pped off at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a strange scene : with a super@@ imposed smile , she was still hanging in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was clear that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jam storm . &quot;
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , you had a strong tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champi@@ onships in 2013 and European Championship , has been tested positively to the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the inqu@@ isi@@ tive dose and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positively in 2010 and closed 21 months . &quot;
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible for eu@@ than@@ asia .
&quot; this year , the 30 year old is over 200 and 400 m the world &apos;s fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranked second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold favor@@ i@@ tin has only been tested positively in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world world champion , clu@@ es were found on the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran out on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ erin viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but had already left this hospital again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are affected , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sions went up again , and a further person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket there was a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; after all , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g demanded several wounded at the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves on possible motives , but it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities had received sec@@ rec@@ y information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still , it is not clear which group is behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police proved their officials all over the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always some small bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace which was used for years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the bloody bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( Level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were carried out a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this grants the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; the Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos , while the country pursu@@ es stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , has benefited himself from having brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine had been killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identical movement &quot; has come to the sight of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional guards in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; said Chairman of the Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; already . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports of contacts with the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the clear increase of legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried , Ma@@ ate expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before . &quot;
that is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum arri@@ vals had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes which had previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slowly that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his un@@ just sporty character which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men are running in a@@ edi@@ cs , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the turn .
some media referred him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; was funny about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim in Olympia only eight months before the competition and never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the New Square has been co@@ ined .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their shop on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; returning the next morning at 8.@@ 15 a.m. , about 250 euros had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .

Tru@@ mp is not so close to the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should there be anything with the election of the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already had an alternative video . &quot;
he then drives into the holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be relatively no matter : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was ok , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric feed vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously large .
the Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
the Group will shortly start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the next year also on the free car market .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been testing for months , whether they are delivered to their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letter and pack@@ et , also to sell to other farms . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Ger@@ der &apos;s post @-@ executive committee had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ factory production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
Ger@@ der had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we circum@@ vent the complete fleet .
the stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the backs came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nürn@@ berger market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management is the world &apos;s number five in front of a staff new beginning .
GF@@ RP Executive Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
&quot; as of September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board will take up the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , who shared the company . &quot;
he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found .
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation as a reason for the res@@ titu@@ tion .
details wanted to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who will lead the market research company in future is still unclear .
&quot; on Friday , at the shareholders of the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced several years ago was large . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen even after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the most recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will at some point become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts like that too , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its dissi@@ pation in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was primarily bur@@ dened with regard to its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the company &apos;s depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience division , generated a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the bottom line . &quot;
the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
&quot; in the case of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries .
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to that , had to do@@ dge up to an opposite truck , which was partly on the counter @-@ track . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade delivered the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and one emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident scene at the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ all from a regular bus service bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of sewage are for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a careful calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was established by the Ministry of Agriculture by the Ministry of Agriculture , Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wastewater treatment systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the equipment in a cost @-@ covering manner . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ et@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the committee , a new calculation of charges for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , surplus or under@@ cover from the preceding calendar period may be equ@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the grave increases in revenue were based on the fact that there were relatively small facilities in all three sewage plants with a very low sewage treatment , which ran@@ ged from 6@@ 800 to 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have an impact on the basis of the low distribution base . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wer volume in all three systems is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculation period , all three systems were not least incurred due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair costs . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be disman@@ tled , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; due to these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were considerably below the current level during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants the expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance are fully sm@@ ashed .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs has been spar@@ ed from the sewage plants over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run according to stone houses , especially since the sewage treatment of the Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater association could not be extended , because it is a matter of deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were posted . &quot;
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ blo@@ ated , self @-@ explan@@ atory tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ concep@@ tions get to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; Yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat told that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was designed as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets were widely distributed over the photos was that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable and in@@ convenient &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not gel @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the descending extrem@@ ity . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural hub .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration fight , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more different in the breed than their older opponents - could tend to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that fast @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white , just male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set up a HR officer focusing on sub@@ divided population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Council of Ar@@ med Forces , Secret Services Committee and the Defense budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services that were typically enjoyed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government leaders have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com enco@@ der publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress C@@ ement from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were played , analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as investigations continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; announced the top ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , who were recorded after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way . &quot;
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence .
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful aviation campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State ev@@ okes quar@@ rels about more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a writing piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these tent@@ ative refin@@ eries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA won four @-@ fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever did . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising f@@ uss through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time she had a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team all went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better way . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull around the ru@@ dder altogether .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close @-@ up area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and took the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US door@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling steady and inevitable , a rapid relay race between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stick , which is handed down from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among the famous names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he is a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold at the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I tend to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many who had asked me did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; trampoline jumping has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ erous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the grace of gym@@ nas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , bit@@ ing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are evaluated according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts need to go on in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes going back and down , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also another major goal in television broadcast : the world or the Olympic @-@ record . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel when watching these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympic @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just breaking up ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas .
&quot; last week , thousands of people burst into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the answer to the government was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist dangers beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , where dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting it , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des who have been forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of self @-@ fl@@ attering under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted they were so prot@@ esting .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , flour@@ ished in politics and economy while they exploited O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively imper@@ vious reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested against the government &apos;s statements apparently by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ical city , managed by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ es flights across the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his allies to collapse in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin atro@@ city . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication cast new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its comrades who try to take refuge in protection during an event@@ ful phase , to explain to the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp ru@@ sted back to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said that he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate doesn &apos;t want to know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism came down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who sees the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has taken an even more corro@@ sive tone because his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to excuse his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while focusing on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s correctness , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back@@ yards , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama served as Minister for Foreign Affairs to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control .
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , &quot; po@@ orer &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once again displaced by the price of the market , Café is coming back to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a bon@@ ded cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
&quot; the business of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people mour@@ ned the last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluding and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it &apos;s also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing associate of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ted onions . &quot;
there are traces of nature .
&quot; the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee dr@@ ink@@ ies for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a s@@ wis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
the café also accepted the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points .
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; opened as the new café , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee would feel like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Bri@@ ck@@ man was told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop , a small , snow@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive trees while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ opping , this was the pair for discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; team of women coo@@ ks for male Fel@@ dar@@ ters and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; the Americans , who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; says Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and asser@@ ole no@@ d@@ ules became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noticed that coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication had priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household appliances &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s house kitchen with his kitchen , he sp@@ ans like a million dollar man from the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours caused by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt , led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to its feet .
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple admitted to the writing of the book the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law understood better - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; She really made people sick . &quot; &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Square , they and Co@@ e drew up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it will be called &quot; &quot; Pr@@ une W@@ hip &quot; , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , and added that it was a practi@@ cable trick to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone showed a bit reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
CO@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people life . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to pull people out of sh@@ attered houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian guard , showing him in a 11 hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrels of barrel over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ i@@ rie is born after 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , this lifestyle seems to be a prescription for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock comments this life span which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist predicted long ago that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie would become st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know correspon@@ dingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks .
&quot; her slow motion , as she showed six animals in front of Spitz@@ bergen , measured her with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean and seek car@@ c@@ asses that are tor@@ mented from higher water layers down .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly large amounts of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempts to drag large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers of length , the lens nucleus had a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at the age of 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication becomes apparent at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such methane al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is not a coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on stuck to the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip was captured on Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on spar@@ es . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal bu@@ ys heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more danger@@ ously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources into a long life . &quot;
construction site in double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the municipal council has dealt with issues relating to building construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Committee adopted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the development , par@@ cel@@ li@@ zation and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ ve@@ ying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ plan@@ ation section 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schö@@ nau reach young families and rebel@@ li@@ ous sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , bau@@ bles can immediately report to the town hall . the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to respond to requests for reloc@@ ation of other commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; therefore , the City of the Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK for so far . &quot;
this is currently taking advantage of large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance review E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk assessment ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg considers a large fund sector , however , as well as Dublin does worse in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city is equipped with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is standing in place seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; according to figures from Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people were working in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , there were 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ se the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . , Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ t from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ el and other in@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was collected on Thursday , U.S. official Beth@@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a decree of the cost incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took care of each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir landed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
&quot; supported by the US troops have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) carry out after the extract of the remaining group of fighters buried within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just run clearing operations , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presi@@ dency of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted revenues of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations on the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hi@@ des behind false pronoun@@ cements and re@@ actors in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax test by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaig@@ ners Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presi@@ dency candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions were not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp Cri@@ tics , among other things the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his contributions to charitable organisations , his business aries and various other connections , particularly with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed himself on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday to publish his tax return in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp .
&quot; on Thursday , she talked about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants , the information that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become an issue . &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial group has its seat , Tru@@ mp on a meeting to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to a control examination of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the clin@@ ton of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 were related to their income as wages , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ Fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with chim@@ e , fire@@ work bodies promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
natur@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ illi powder .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion along with the US conservation of protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many wood@@ p@@ liers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is a world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , being much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without causing the eleph@@ ants to do so , &quot; &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is cast . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ illi powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned on to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ illi powder into the air . &quot;
a hint is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last chance is a fer shooting a gold @-@ burning fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

&quot; the City Council , however , rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ski on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ people , but at this location in a exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; sum@@ mons - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots en@@ gros@@ sed a media uprising after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre @-@ election , since Arab people had requested a &quot; &quot; employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
he wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; shocked him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliberate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election was deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this really is very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big response in the Internet , where people named it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some sub@@ mits to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel that is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct command to &quot; &quot; take Israel into the quick @-@ dial @-@ list &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police are using tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police deployed tear gas and rub@@ bers against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when the police officers tried to disp@@ el the students , which led to the police rub@@ bers and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters were faced with gra@@ ffiti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest in Russian companies on businesses grew strongly in the country , the ambassador dealt with . &quot;
Russian companies focus on existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trading exchange between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trading break was achieved through deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes to Russia for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists .
&quot; last year the Russian exp@@ atri@@ ation issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market to fall in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack has been done on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the au@@ spices of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bed their faces from the staff of the beverage market drove out the issue of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
how much money has been captured does not share the police .
&quot; the perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , i.e. relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the attack , the cul@@ pr@@ its must be banned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the car park , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; whoever has made observations at the time of the crime ( at about 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should report urgently to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer season
eight beautiful and cheerful days the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers during their summer vac@@ ancy in N@@ uss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of the school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to B@@ retten with the visit of the string z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and p@@ add@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers were treated to culinary delights such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops was prepared , beautiful jewellery made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the Ey@@ gh@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch in St. Anna &apos;s pastoral care unit were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together four stages were tac@@ kled .
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ pilgrimage trip of all min@@ stran@@ ts over the course of two years , the round of ministers St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s town of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy on the Freiburg cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms made their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and par@@ ted the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster &apos;s beloved wife is standing and so the pilgrimage route was taken from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches always made a break to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the parish hei@@ ms of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and stimulating dinner and breakfast . &quot;
we continued the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , one stepped down the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at the same time , some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the pond in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive convent church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by the operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to see the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ged last night in the male team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
&quot; they repeated the trick after starting in March at the train world champi@@ onships in London , despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired en@@ gen@@ dered a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner scored a Olympics ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round in the stand@@ ings rounds . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , driving down in a higher gear , to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they got on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic ch@@ ord in the final round and the world champion was defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der said that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England &apos;s rival .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who have won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would come the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; he had disputed yesterday with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong web @-@ wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a scar@@ f of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing demonstrations as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached the perfect moment its climax , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy yield question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the start of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a maxim@@ inum payout set for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - might be at risk in a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melting furnace consum@@ es about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through melting &quot; , &quot; the company shared . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription to the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; to operate the melting furnace or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still another explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the bad economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both plants were to disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the electricity market . &quot;
&quot; and for us as generating sets that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and went to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to weeping , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , descri@@ p@@ tive reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ on@@ els and producers of keeping up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we should have forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more an image tape as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding fashion@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is expected to be so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still se@@ eping through the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ il &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who are exhibiting in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
&quot; these feelings co@@ ded again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover . &quot;
&quot; but on the mis@@ fortune , it seems to pass by the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is shown in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; there are 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary towers are rejected annually by the municipal coun@@ cill@@ ors , while the sector focuses on the effects of further short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s community headquarters said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers found that thousands of people are dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will shor@@ ten the funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and the Federal Justice Minister and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to see the needs of community centers and their communities , as well as the fact that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Ele@@ ction Camp@@ a@@ ign accused of allegedly comm@@ itting weapons
new York : Donald Tru@@ mps Camp@@ a@@ ign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that their campaign manager for North Carolina had a fire@@ arm directed to a staff while they were on the road in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday at Charlotte B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s regional court , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i had been waiting for months to have waited for the matter to be regulated internally , before he realised that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , drew his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the race at Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; having compla@@ ined at the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip he gave the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a rebellion , when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was to appoint and appoint judges . &quot;
the campaign clearly states that the media would have torn his words out of the context and that he would not force himself to violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint requires damages from the campaign to viol@@ ate the duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; calls for consulting companies , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties are notable . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys of the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD stri@@ pped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent off five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iles just before the CD@@ U , which could rise again to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD ( SPD ) of the survey showed only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U was only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it still sm@@ iles behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite pal@@ p@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hannover as the &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and emails at that time , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even accessing web pages was possible via HTML browsers , albeit agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone was folded like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates providers that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s daily life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion Smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; in addition , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three instruments in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator to easily operate everything by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the triumph of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the following . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ Berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we took a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of extending He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ass ourselves on the world stage .
they were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in weather growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - which was built five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ play &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block display lock@@ ings on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it told that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding with regard to its advertising advertisements to make it more difficult to identify what part of the page advertising is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth fight between the time @-@ consuming open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has interven@@ ed in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
&quot; according to a study published last year from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenues . &quot;
&quot; the company has sold it to desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile to invest in such a step . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; to have more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook maintained that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
wife suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was taken over by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud .
&quot; a woman sat in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them to report this as well as any witnesses of the incident . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases where one person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent killing was acqu@@ itted after having over@@ drive and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street .
&quot; the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation &quot; , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate researchers .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could once open up similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , similar atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also prof@@ ited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus displays its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously suspected by planet researchers . &quot;
&quot; although it was formerly inhabited , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billion years . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ate and their steam was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and brought low co @-@ determination to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and only wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he took the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ ee@@ oil workers resume talks , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the labour disputes relating to wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties sit on the table for a new round of discussion , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the wood @-@ field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the un@@ winding process of the current strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop several day sessions over the next few weeks that will start early next year in order to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ s in the North Sea by around 9 per cent , due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation , which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes , which took place in the North Sea since one generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at different rates , as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to planetary origin . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , created around 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars run large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than the massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotating slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , when , and why stars are slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ aden rot@@ ational rates that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star appears
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with achievement .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;

&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field , so controversial is its occurrence outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star gave &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have banned ster@@ oids banned between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;

&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland should not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese swimming instructors Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final more than 100 m butterfly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the alle@@ gations of over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news circul@@ ated through the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive himself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should act in the forbidden substance for the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing medium . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ Trial had already had a positive impact . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both order intake , however , both may not start in the class until 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of athletes the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had forbidden the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous violations in China had also led to fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ an attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over to me , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focus of a debate with Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun had a positive effect on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;

programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims are willing to pay the ran@@ som required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetrators are speci@@ alizing their black@@ mail software according to Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes &apos;s observations on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be pressed is considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ator discovered black@@ mail software for itself .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , she searches for recently changed files such as word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; in order to get the end key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to dis@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals already have been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of the companies , who pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know that and try to build up a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure investigated the usage areas and contact with the black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators actually try to build a type of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims by chat on how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and will be redeemed by private individuals after payments of just a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the hack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
black@@ mail then searches for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ t another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per certified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the dissem@@ ination , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
&quot; the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies , who secure their data better . &quot;
over 50 percent of the IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the perpetrators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential of damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators could also take entirely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the Def@@ con hack@@ ers conference , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat integrated with the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have plenty of room in the front row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit top falls somewhat . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ ranking and 10@@ 26 l back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like chin @-@ up and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling .
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do some qui@@ eter work . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top variant &quot; Executive . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( working until Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assist assist . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when manoeu@@ v@@ ring , he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
&quot; and the intelligent template re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition , and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when required . &quot;
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is only conceivable for dangers that are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee leg in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
&quot; after their journey , sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
&quot; in this case , a family was severely ill in diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ way . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted sea water .
the family felt that the journey was poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not have any success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant indeed was defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er learned about the plain@@ ti@@ ff shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duties of information , thus the verdict . &quot;
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to con@@ ta@@ gion among each other - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 .
&quot; after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist attacks .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and division . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if criminals have to leave the country more quickly , it will increase security and strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit range over several years . &quot;
promoting terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; video monitoring should be improved , the tru@@ ce can be changed so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is made more difficult . &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated duty of confidentiality for doctors should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister maintains a better social care . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly opposed Action .
&quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ stick for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear would be problematic under constitutional law .
&quot; one cannot forbi@@ d everything that is borrow@@ ed , and I reject the use of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or witnesses to court .
&quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist acts and ability to act responsi@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of residence right bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway toll
it st@@ alls regularly on the circum@@ navigation road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jams when they drive over the Motor@@ way to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the state @-@ owned road construction will extend the distance between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler street downhill to 700 meters . &quot;
drive directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is split up early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerv@@ s the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , the traffic is directed only one lane over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rebuilt in a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to record heavy @-@ duty traffic in particular . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years have to be expected : because the bridge has an official remaining time of remaining until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ weaker time during school holidays because with disabilities it is expected to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday , traffic is passed on track at the construction site . &quot;
cross @-@ cultural journey : cultural offerings for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are planning a music project .
the N@@ ima Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima Association , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the production in the little house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; the majority of young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from language , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without an escape and migration background are to be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical voice transm@@ issions are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star scales are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us appearing in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes for them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter we@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for sleeping and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; but the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is an inhal@@ ation and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; especially the sleeping experience makes many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German household medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
&quot; in@@ frequently , the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
and it can be that various factors need each other .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor .
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; behavi@@ our@@ al changes include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; dor@@ man@@ t dor@@ ms are hardly available in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ xes , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should consult the doctor in case of sleeping problems . &quot;
this can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
&quot; for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with respiratory drop@@ outs , in sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ xes explains . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after shor@@ tening , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is drawn to the ceiling of the sleeping . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and ir@@ regul@@ arities , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television to fall asleep , stop drinking alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to have
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time and at the same time exhibited his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in the criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € premium and a junk King 15@@ 0.000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the subsi@@ dy system in swimming is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good . &quot;
we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see or even operate in the topic of dop@@ ing .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;

airport : gang of Bag@@ gage Ad@@ ded
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , police officers of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ s- and baggage @-@ pil@@ es as gang members .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang , known as the police from the past theft of theft . &quot;
&quot; for the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several crimes . &quot;
the specialists of the Criminal Police 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves which have been submitted to Germany specifically for the off@@ ing of crimes committed to Germany .
&quot; at the same time , they had collected more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one comes past play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone has spra@@ yed &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; in comparison to a Li@@ dl , who will soon be demol@@ ished , it will be built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will however be favor@@ ed with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior cur@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground , closed off parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the building workers on behalf of the unknown owner of the house have the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street appears peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , are mostly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make up between hous@@ et@@ akers and their neighbours , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional working class district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police regulations , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and were still inhabited by the people whom they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and bal@@ lot liners from around the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognized by thrown discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with colored bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; Left Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
most of the off@@ ences make property damage that tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant next to the disputed 94 years , there can be no question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ rd : people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are not sure . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga .
&quot; for the architect architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the streets of Riga - and has remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of interpretation over the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless re@@ constructions in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for en@@ gen@@ ders who are angry about color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene belong to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise . &quot;
all persons presented only with first names have asked to not be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee tri@@ bunal
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee support , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the jeal@@ ous Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ously than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the passage . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
she has limited a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dwell@@ ings .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the Commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so far as one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
therefore community dwell@@ ings must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the washing machine . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be consolidated or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here are administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; if you develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , he could not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; however , problem cases also exist , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the most recent occur@@ ren@@ ces are afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly says &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would bring them off completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine says . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and honorary officials must look for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they have always been in the background that a new impetus could soon come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics shy away . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to hire them on @-@ site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived there where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the police helicopter flew several areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
&quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot;
the occup@@ ant surprised the two and struck the b@@ ump@@ y into the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , carried both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; on the occasion of the arrest , the police attacked several stri@@ kers as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the f@@ ain@@ ting proc@@ eeded without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , indeed , fell near the apartment or during their escape . &quot;
