<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their feast, they hunted home in the fast gallop at home."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself be led by his family through the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swear for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and therefore also at CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help handed the man from Anhausen to the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"dear readers, as these audiobooks are in German, it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting young talent."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US MasterWinner was admitted to the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"these are the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gieng, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are unone in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Who knows about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep them small and warn that the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate them to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, Trump claims."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it will massively return regulations, and it will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"needless to say, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical Teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could still be party-internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement he wants to quit."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton wants to explicitly strengthen and demand renewables with its investment programme:" "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America -- I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpific trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but just to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid even better, for example Clinton asks."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics believe him, that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is a part of women who escape alone almost daily.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her small son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's help."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experience on her flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as the hope-makers", "she tells."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" many of them steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary killings, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs require a sexual act for a bottle of water, is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of the women living in the apartment in the Munich North are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children were certainly not born voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying that they do not say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't know how to help, there are more accommodations just for them, calls Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, answers some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men separately."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or the men and women are accommodated together, it can become - ongoing - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the shower rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the rush that it gives to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have spoken about that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance specialists have called on their union to approve new employment policies in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more safety measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that there were ministers agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who were published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had persistently quiet" problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations on all your worries."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrow, and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved like nothing worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was uprooted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin split and accused Ankara to fall into Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"to rebuild the veto becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the government controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara for months."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has challenged this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he became a coup d "état last month in a failed coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedasti stated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it considers the response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persistent resentment on the worm empower of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian Head of State won a bonus in Ankara for claiming that after the attempted coup d'état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents were saying that they had not even ripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once more."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he later was a protocol manager and Chief of Staff of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the ridiculousness for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">"so, here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?"</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president - would once again lead Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - complaining items for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov participated in the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term coup would have violated the Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another nearby Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the northern deck of the Queensland Crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Business Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland Crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a hot activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a gong for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high-rise and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or west side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very cheerful activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an ascent of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances on which the team works, they were tiny - only a few millimetres were lying on each side."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building profitable homes in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: investors are supposed to be much stronger in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "Living concept" "for the next council session."</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to point 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be produced in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big dispute in the town hall is, however, said Bratmann:" how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not yet complete: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which were to be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do we compare the loss of further 1,300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, as planned spokesperson Nicole Palm, the city should now be bought outgoing bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring flats back to price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city there are periods of time at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, it is removed from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D Group president Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a large majority the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on staring on screens, was complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">"at Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters, which were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created from it)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, interest sunk before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the server overloads.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the car and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person restores each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the Washington Post reported that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, the number of people followed by 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data about performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take" "30 minutes of time" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "be active every day", "because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people looking elend."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly engage in sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even hunt new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also grumpy players who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk around a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What shall it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to poker success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world and help many people hunt, more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bila has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"it expected it to be a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, arrived on Friday at 09.00 the highest level that was ever recorded."</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still inflicted people out of flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those saved on Friday near Gloster."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house, is rising overnight."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we woke up and the water warmed and poured in," said Hansford. "</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years, in which she lived there."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities, and he was the only one who can swim."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday."</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flooding had spread rapidly since there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer reported about 13.75 inches of rain near Livingstone from midnight to Friday."</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground was fully sucked by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"the authorities stated that heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa, Parish and Loss in five school districts."</seg>
<seg id="27">The WWW CBS subsidiary reported that an orderly in Tangipahoa attacked 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were both flooded."</seg>
<seg id="29">"the leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets, washed up by floods."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the town of Hammond of the commune of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flooding water and sand bags for the residents to take part, hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops."</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration. "</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in Mississipp, the Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast."</seg>
<seg id="36">"according to his statements, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooding, but no reports have been reported on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years."</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it still comes."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present to myself at the gymnasium in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnoses, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female female companions was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner in the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we don't see trainers all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same path as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic Games will only have four players in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnast in first place in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for the training, training, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turner and families). the list can be continued as desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnoses receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the congregations aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach gymnastics training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected him."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt has revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS was found in a" "Niemandsland" "and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend endars in order to improve the maintenance of periods of time."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance Specialists shared the last night in a communication with:" "assistance doctors have still had serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will incite the current occupancy crisis and it is agreed to address all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">"for only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through discussions struggled with the government to participate and sometimes deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">"this happened because of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made about it last month, that his door would always be open."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistance doctors."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if he does not do so, the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strip chain."</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the BMA wants better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistants who are subject to the contract."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Daniel Mortimer, General Director of NHS employees, urged the assistance doctors to stop the strike."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mortimer said:" "work combat measures do not achieve anything but little, but already burdened teams and service providers and prepare patients, nurses and their families only worry, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last two months, we talked to the assistant of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the guardianship and the whistle-leblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important subjects - such as sending, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, education holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture boosts electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from the office due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles intervenes verbally the police, election observers and councillors to have ignored proofs of electoral abuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnities and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Communal Government, who is now a response king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elective cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should lead an ID card, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"currently, a voter must name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He urges that the press should have more access to congregational documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only for election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the current mayor of Luton should be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a litany."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign based on the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of a imitation in which one person elects someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence throughout the country for fraud.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed particularly alarming for the fraudulent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding levies to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in its report it says:" "as evidence has been appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection documents to stop" reaping. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choosing options before choosing to ask for your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on a person's finger, as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible for voting.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications to an automatic letter-code.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists work full briefing and envelopes of letter elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up shut-off stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation facilitated an accusation due to intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (National Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the elective stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees usually enforce that voters go alone into the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric runs over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlet case there was no criminal complaint."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has declared Luton Rahman and his representative for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in the criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "checkups" of the election registration departments of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and throttle of a serious test - by hiding some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shred his course on a Euro ticket, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a migratory toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the emptying of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will let himself in."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea to lick the washing button of a migratory toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he leaned, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to railway stations to washing knobs of toilets, the task set his immune system definitively below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial underscore showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their luminometry number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more juridical than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here anything because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had arded some of the things I had instructed him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their home after delogiation with a loss of £50,000, because they had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, showered employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had holes, wooden boards were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who lived meanwhile in the apartment, and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive cries, strikers and flights included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which will be demolished under certain circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were piled up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the road and had to be called by the police regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogiated her and her partner this week forcibly from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours, who said their life was made to hell."</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't shrieve anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, tomorrow we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the rampant side of the community building waste and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, since delogiation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be awful for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogiation on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as garages, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon got a fine-out after she had found herself guilty of the possession of a class B drug.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon was, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graffiti with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delegate tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared that the delogiation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without selections, as well as those who were harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate any criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"who doesn't fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the Chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in short, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting tens of thousands of detainees coming from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, even" some hundred thousand, "the president of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard advance of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight against the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already outstripped Kurdish high burners with criminal charges, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the icy putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that receives refugees, produces refugees in their own country," "said Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the chief of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">Erdogan wants to raise the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The chief of the Federation demanded that the Federal Government repositioned itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, a witch hunt takes place against Erdogan-critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last few months, I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>

<seg id="20">"who doesn't fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalist and Säkularen," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on figures by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Turks already ordered the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia should not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"until 2021, the Parliament election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"as far as so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day struggle - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most vacationers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up voices only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign just close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting to see how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionality.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive electoral campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seering won't get cold feet and chancellor Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" "We create" "has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when you make election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale conferences twice; Angela Merkel is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently at NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely waives the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, only plays a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that on the land you crumble the base that it needs to be very strict again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any one in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert is also self-exposing:" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is in the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats lagged down 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in polls, should make the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their holidays and move their election campaign largely to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="34">"apart from that, green elective warriors embark on trace search for native voices among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and finds it even more beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 remediation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5: 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made everything very jagged," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the counterparts of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation trips."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again, the transport situation within the village has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now move from Ofterdingen out of the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Escaping through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partial complaints," says the deputy head director Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many detours were seeking and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks relocated to residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the community increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable exaggerations," "says King, who made himself on the spot on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been inflamed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest one was on the way with 77 hourly kilometres in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become more quiet."</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenues in sales, lets everyone look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some more and some are less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the end customer, so for other companies, has hardly any consequences for this."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "maximum slight decline", "but also admits that, of course," the running history is missing. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most exploited are the restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all restaurants were" hard hit. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil are missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"sales revenues are based on" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"the road painting has thrown back its operations" "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, government president Jörg Schmidt stated on a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where such funding has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulators are now less frequented because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot drive, it is also very different."</seg>
<seg id="42">"after the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="2">"after the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière is now laying out a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say about all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the serverry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically reasonable for the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not overcall anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, further points would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as Minister of the Interior, however, he was on the basis of results and on a" recoverable consensus "within the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière gave a little time to submit before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some are already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and truce rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and knock jihadists with double citizenship from the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU-man admits. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still holds this for reasonable and does not demand anything, which is not a chance for the coalitioneer anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">These are partly in themselves: he plans quick-procedure for deportations and more possibilities for detaching people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of Dulsions for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to obscure their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some are still unaffected and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated ones for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee numbers."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply occupied were not clinging out even in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormously focused.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are elections."</seg>
<seg id="35">"on the subject of internal security, the Union and the SPD are increasingly turning into position."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, it went up between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garriser argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burka ban and a departure from the double nationality."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also struggles for reconciling sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a reversal of the double pass, he keeps nothing."</seg>
<seg id="40">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>

<seg id="5">Volkswagen will start in the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered.</seg>
<seg id="6">"despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's biggest car will continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in July, VW's core brand was weakening mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as stated in the Dax company."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, according to China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month."</seg>
<seg id="10">Deliveries by almost one sixth in the home market in Germany declined.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Jürgen Stackmann, head of market sales, brought back the weaker figures from July above all to two sales days less in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, in some core markets, there has been a purchase restraint in some core markets."</seg>

<seg id="16">"all in all, the primarily affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is further off lightly due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an emission of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is beech."</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales director Fred Kappler was able to present a sales figure from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, worldwide 5,904 million."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen was manipulated with a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, Volkswagen invokes about 2.5 million vehicles for retrofitting into the workshops."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the course of retrofitting, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects."</seg>

<seg id="23">"after refitting the car, the car hire a" guaranteed "certificate, but do not speak of a" guarantee "as it was stated on Friday in corporate travel."</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal details.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee of modified diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">"last Monday, this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA fully.</seg>
<seg id="29">"discrepancies are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion, no deteriorations take place and all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">"with the wide term" guarantee, "Volkswagen will be able to see that customers for example come into a workshop six months after the conversion - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"even in the interests of customers, it is important to avoid that in any other damages which have nothing to do with the scandal, a uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations comes as it was said."</seg>

<seg id="2">Solitary middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section, to omit it under the pseudonym non-allele men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reformation of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers are more likely to retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wildly stuffy before I stop, hold my hands and say something special:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men of middle aged) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight men of middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought objects he sold when he was young and broken.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on YouGov's profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media track, people who heard about the comeback and were forced to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of adherents to the recess of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of familiar sound plates, of objects, the happy adjusting entries."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to get involved mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flutes from a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, don't own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I flatten out a pile of Bossa novellas compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently here and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-class."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who only come in slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"lop, dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beast's latest Synthesizer- and sexbepacked pop instead of experimental jazz groans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but psychic traumas are hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more like a shopping spreader than buying a big shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a loved sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the appearance to brave jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid Cameras, before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley plate player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research finds that the results of YouGov agree, they can be considered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not by strolling through sheet-shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the starchy view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rages over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid, and which hold a fire and sanity risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely nourishing people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the downfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest are eight years old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the jungle-bearing rose to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a master class in handling, side quilting, back-back, line run, and raw power to win gold - her first Olympiamedaille of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was swept by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the big defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in the form of this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game of the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this cap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started amazingly and had fun off the attacks of GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if you were running in driving busses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrific tack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to reach a third goal but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute athjasa Veremalua in the right corner a Touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-whistle and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presses further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through to a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the Südseeinsulan, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked crushing into the lawn."</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past Fiji Japan defeated Japan in semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the British 15-Aside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinaleric gold than with these games and that will be what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first stroke down to the last 220 hard Hieve, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was the first women in the history of the British Sports, who laid on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter unwritten commitment, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphes."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference, and it was no more assistant than the coach who did not know whether to survive this day at all, when it was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had good luck that he could start treatment early 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances the right concept is at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing on itself is a challenge, but it makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-provoking morning to talk more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I and Helen and Robin have worked for.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to lock up, panning and glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be torn.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want fireworks, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to conceive that I am an Olympic Champion."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the sector from green electricity extraction are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains with the release of the Renewable Energies environment in the existing systems for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption, to the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed."</seg>
<seg id="13">Special significance is the success of Gabriel for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in view of our campaign" "Steel is Future", "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of the emissions trading segment, climate and employment targets are to be weighed down," "said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation escalated further than the world's largest producer in China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies prize dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has a little relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties on import steel show effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how long the price will be picked up.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been rather stagnant."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at last, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to each other for the second month."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production grew by two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Spirit, Health: singing doves seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp's whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the Lehramt he studied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular gatherings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to talk and organize, to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs get out of the dolls even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, collective singing had a much higher significance; it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, explains them."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through song lyrics and especially melodies, self-infected people detain from long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in addition, singing will also demand a special achievement, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm, and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people who live alone, exercise not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir too.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show itself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and more vigilant about me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"one does not sing alone - for 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, Seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings of the circle of acquaintances in a seniors' choir, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether from the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also Austrian citizens are affected, it is still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, so Schnöll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin exploded two bombs on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning, two explosions went up again, and a further person was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket there was a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the popular bathing beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured following police instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"after all, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang demanded several wounded at the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves on possible motives, but it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"instead, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities had received secrecy information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">"still, it is not clear which group is behind the attacks."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police proved their officials all over the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always some small bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace which was used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"following the bloody bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (Level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were carried out a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This grants the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to instigate chaos, while the country pursues stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, has benefited himself from having brought the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"almost a year ago in Bangkok, an attack on a popular Hindu shrine had been killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="23">"with a view to the clear increase of legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maate said he would not yet speak of new rightist terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the bold appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the Aquatics Center, the slightly obese swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ends with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his unjust sporty character which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in sub-represented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen are running in aedics, Habte wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soon the first nicknames made the turn.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred him as "Robel of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" "well-being" "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "was funny about him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over 100 metres of freestyle, played no part."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a pre-run over 100 metres of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim in Olympia only eight months before the competition and never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"as of 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic meter of sewage are for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (so far 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (so far 2,18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the installation in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a careful calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was established by the Ministry of Agriculture by the Ministry of Agriculture, Kulmbach, that for these wastewater treatment systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the market Kasendorf is obliged to operate the equipment in a cost-covering manner."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zuletberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt presented the committee, a new calculation of charges for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, surplus or undercover from the preceding calendar period may be equated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the grave increases in revenue were based on the fact that there were relatively small facilities in all three sewage plants with a very low sewage treatment, which ranged from 6800 to 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"thus, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have an impact on the basis of the low distribution base."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the sewer volume in all three systems is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the recumbent calculation period, all three systems were not least incurred due to their age of refurbishment and repair costs."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be dismantled, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "due to these extraordinary expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were considerably below the current level during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants the expenditures for operation and maintenance are fully smashed.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of great entertainment costs has been spared from the sewage plants over the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be precarious in the long run according to stone houses, especially since the sewage treatment of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association could not be extended, because it is a matter of deficit."</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as an Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unbloated, self-explanatory tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All misconceptions get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "Yellow face." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was designed as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Savapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets were widely distributed over the photos was that the filter was" "vulnerable and inconvenient". ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not gel-proof, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the descending extremity."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural hub.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration fight, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more different in the breed than their older opponents - could tend to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user, it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was earlier," "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that fast-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the big part white, just male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say about it. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company has recently set up a HR officer focusing on subdivided population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu also said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added," "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.". ""</seg>

<seg id="2">"in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Council of Armed Forces, Secret Services Committee and the Defense budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence services that were typically enjoyed by high-ranking CentCom commanders regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed, and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct indications that government leaders have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom encoder publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress Cement from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were played, analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an excessively restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "announced the top ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morals among analysts and "gave excessively little space for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the CentCom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, who were recorded after complaints by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful aviation campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State evokes quarrels about more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a writing piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these tentative refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms dam, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time she had a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played sport at the Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team all went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better way."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work place in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull around the rudder altogether.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and took the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US doorkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling steady and inevitable, a rapid relay race between competition and pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stick, which is handed down from the crossbow to the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among the famous names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he is a swimmers, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold at the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I tend to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely perceived that many who had asked me did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"trampoline jumping has some outsiders, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the kartoonerous trembling of his never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, biting and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the execution, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists need to go on in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes going back and down, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also another major goal in television broadcast: the world or the Olympic-record."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel when watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympic-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthropoids and the objectivity of male athletes - according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people burst into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the answer to the government was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist dangers beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and do not have any other options except protesting it, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades who have been forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of self-flattering under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they reside."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, flourished in politics and economy while they exploited Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-publicized illness for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively impervious reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of polls protested against the government's statements apparently by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharical city, managed by Tigray, and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for drones flights across the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin atrocity."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification cast new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings its comrades who try to take refuge in protection during an eventful phase, to explain to the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rusted back to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted Mr. Trump to weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate doesn't want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism came down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "according to how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who sees the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken an even more corrosive tone because his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head races in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while focusing on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trump's correctness, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backyards, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops out of Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama served as Minister for Foreign Affairs to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going on each of his words and being biased against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, "poorer" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!." "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apology as only a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his climb to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to Americans how they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Brickman was told in their book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, snowy snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive trees while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hopping, this was the pair for discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanuts, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be placed in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"team of women cooks for male Feldarters and it was served fresh baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Americans, who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for Americans became a central, tense theme," says Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and asserole nodules became staple food, the casserole was a" "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers", "Brickman noticed that cooks were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification had priority over taste or even wholesome kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish of this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the house recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, household economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, between 1923 and 1943 - the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household appliances "and the challenge to transform Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-cake-Essen-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's house kitchen with his kitchen, he spans like a million dollar man from the world to which he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the hypocrisy of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours caused by Mrs. Roosevelt, led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country returned to its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, Brickman said, as well as on how science was applied to food."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the couple admitted to the writing of the book the eating habits of Brickman's mother-in-law understood better - for example, how they could not throw food away."</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of wasting food," "said Coe."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-arks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland hairie is born after 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark floats along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this lifestyle seems to be a prescription for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "in any case from a Greenland-shark, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock comments this life span which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist predicted long ago that Grönlandhaie would become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-arks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her slow motion, as she showed six animals in front of Spitzbergen, measured her with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean and seek carcasses that are tormented from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest size was 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly large amounts of carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts to drag large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lens nucleus had a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticular nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark might be 392 years old with 502 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at the age of 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication becomes apparent at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methane alemes live mainly in icy waters, is not a coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland wal, in whose bacon stuck to the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was captured on Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on spares."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal buys heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the Eyghal-Haigerloch in St. Anna's pastoral care unit were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were tackled.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next Rompilgrimage trip of all minstrants over the course of two years, the round of ministers St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop's town of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of mercy on the Freiburg cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms made their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and parted the pilgrim's blessing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster's beloved wife is standing and so the pilgrimage route was taken from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writing texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis at field crossings, chapels or churches always made a break to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the parish heims of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and stimulating dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after that, one stepped down the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at the same time, some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive convent church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis met at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by the operator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the divine service, pilgrims were able to see the sacristy and the high altar."</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">"at the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped."</seg>

<seg id="1">Scotsman Callum Skinner stormed home when Brite Gold won for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raged last night in the male team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after starting in March at the train world championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired engendered a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner scored a Olympics chord in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won the first round in the standings rounds."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder was almost back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, driving down in a higher gear, to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic chord in the final round and the world champion was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hinder said that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, who have won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a apparently holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would come the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had disputed yesterday with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong web-wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a scarf of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing demonstrations as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached the perfect moment its climax, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy yield questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - are at stake, as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the start of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout set for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - might be at risk in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effect as the melting furnace consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the complex is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting", "the company shared."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force from November 2016 onwards."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription to the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... "to operate the melting furnace or to ensure the power supply to the melt" is not impaired. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said that 2010 concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still another explanation why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the bad economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland Schmelzer in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts" statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity per year. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the electricity market."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as generating sets that wouldn't be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the sought-after September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and went to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to weeping," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), descriptive reality video showing the entire Kardashian family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz-onels and producers of keeping up Ryan Seacrest): they all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché plot almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we should have forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles more an image tape as a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (According fashionista were 615 pages of advertising) from the 832 pages of the Wälzer."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the unveiling of his cover stars is expected to be so eagerly awaited, that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still seeping through the official announcement."</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities that moil "as" models, the celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who are exhibiting in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners does not like success to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">"these feelings coded again, when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but on the misfortune, it seems to pass by the point."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters are selling images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good at hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite palpable."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, which would range today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the Cebit computer trade fair in Hannover as the "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and emails at that time, even by fax was the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even accessing web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit agonizing slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone was folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen were found.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today dominates providers that all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people's daily life."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion Smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, on Samsung and Apple alone 555 million units."</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">"in addition, the well-running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are coming."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the meantime, a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones."</seg>
<seg id="32">"he promised three instruments in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator to easily operate everything by touch screen."</seg>
<seg id="33">"the triumph of Apple began, even today, the iPhone is the company's most important product."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the following."</seg>
<seg id="35">"they finally disappeared, BlackBerry has to fight."</seg>
<seg id="36">The saws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on average, every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone."</seg>

<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamass ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">They were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in weather growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which was built five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented walkways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a" cat and mouse game. ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that there would block display lockings on its desktop side, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it told that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding with regard to its advertising advertisements to make it more difficult to identify what part of the page advertising is."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" "this kind of Hin-and-forth fight between the time-consuming open source community and the converters has already been underway since the invention of display lockers," "and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has intervened in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators for the industry have become.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study published last year from Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display lockers; almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenues."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the company has sold it to desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, shared a speaker."</seg>
<seg id="11">"advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenues, so Facebook appears to be worthwhile to invest in such a step."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its" "ad preferences tool" "to have more control over them."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook maintained that Adblocks would be worrying new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"for the users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a spokesman on Facebook in an email message. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"ad blockers are a mute means, which is why we instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into the hands of people."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was taken over by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman sat in the dark" "in an act of despair" "on the street and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was passed by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police told them to report this as well as any witnesses of the incident."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases where one person ran in the dark on the highway, it was decided that drivers don't have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policeman of the negligent killing was acquitted after having overdrive and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne."</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the Court found that the policewoman had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a" "totally unusual and unforeseeable situation", "the judge said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could once open up similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, similar atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also profited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus displays its daily side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously suspected by planet researchers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was formerly inhabited, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporate and their steam was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating at different rates, as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to planetary origin."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="8">"at peak rotational rates, these mature stars run large amounts of constellations."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims are willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are specializing their blackmail software according to Malwarebytes's observations on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to be pressed is considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrator discovered blackmail software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, she searches for recently changed files such as word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the end key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptowing Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to disrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals already have been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pay not, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of the companies, who pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know that and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers from F-Secure investigated the usage areas and contact with the blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a type of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims by chat on how they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will be redeemed by private individuals after payments of just a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits have been created by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Blackmail then searches for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per certified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with the dissemination," Wisniewski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"the risk of ransomware is now known by many companies, who secure their data better."</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful exhaustion, the perpetrators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means that the potential of damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could also take entirely new targets on the internet of things in the future."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Defcon hackers conference, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat integrated with the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have plenty of room in the front row as well as in the rear, it does not work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit top falls somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is not just a trunk of 453 l for high-ranking and 1026 l backrests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like chin-up and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he should do some quieter work."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top variant "Executive."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant (working until Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane assist assist."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warning sometimes irritates, because when manoeuvring, he assesses many obstacles as" approaching objects. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and the intelligent template reacts to the traffic sign recognition, and throttles the speed when required."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and therefore are somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">"with HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, stresses Hans-Günter weeß, member of the board of the German Society for sleeping and sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but the insomnia, therefore, is an inhalation and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"especially the sleeping experience makes many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German household medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">"infrequently, the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is most common in depression," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"behavioural changes include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"dormant dorms are hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fixes, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, you should consult the doctor in case of sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the case of snoring with respiratory dropouts, in sleep transducers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fixes explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after shortening, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera is drawn to the ceiling of the sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleeping and irregularities, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch television to fall asleep, stop drinking alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not affect the first sight, but the police counts them to the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the road from east to west, one comes past playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bioladen."</seg>
<seg id="3">"on the facade of a grey house, someone has sprayed" ugly! ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"in comparison to a Lidl, who will soon be demolished, it will be built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments."</seg>
<seg id="5">"articles about this" "trendy district", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will however be favored with burning cars in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior curator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, closed off parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the building workers on behalf of the unknown owner of the house have the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street appears peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, are mostly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protection against vandaliatory leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between housetakers and their neighbours, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working class district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police regulations, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and were still inhabited by the people whom they had occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and ballot liners from around the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized by thrown discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with colored bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "Left Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make property damage that tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant next to the disputed 94 years, there can be no question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weird: people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are not sure."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the streets of Riga - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of interpretation over the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless reconstructions in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well drunk," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for engenders who are angry about color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene belong to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who draws, should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise."</seg>

<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here are administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"if you develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, he could not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, problem cases also exist, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the most recent occurrences are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine's customer clearly says" "what some naive may call". ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitized."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would bring them off completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and honorary officials must look for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new impetus could soon come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics shy away."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to hire them on-site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we haven't arrived there where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
