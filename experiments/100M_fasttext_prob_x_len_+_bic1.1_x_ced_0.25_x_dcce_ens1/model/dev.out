Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just am@@ using .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about the dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes the ongoing settlement of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election of Israel im@@ minent . &quot;
Professor to have shot his girlfriend in an emergency call
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a somewhat irrit@@ ating voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was scri@@ b@@ bled upon a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police She@@ er@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
by the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teacher . &quot;
students were saying they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ cements died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both included in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lanes when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he did his doctorate in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long@@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met by common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson city of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ cements were obviously together some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter , now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ l when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer @-@ fair market three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online . &quot;
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertaining co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted Bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were standing up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch vi@@ gil , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans supported this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot him , and that he called his wife Pr@@ enti@@ a in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two had ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many christ@@ mas seasonal employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it would plan to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers all over the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated paraly@@ sis and a scar@@ let distance from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , together with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; In@@ str@@ it@@ ably the largest time @-@ travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey figures show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks with surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them even won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mps staying power and start letting their dollars flow to pl@@ unge .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
shri@@ mps favourite values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , Mon@@ mouth @-@ University &apos;s survey showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
only two of ten say that they would &quot; upset &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see vanity temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting claims , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their scholarship holders , Republi@@ can voters maintain Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P voters will consider Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans were gathering for another candidate , Tru@@ mp hits almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the squ@@ ad leadership while anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have firmly given their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; yet Tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; two months ago , the immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ siveness of Tru@@ mp will keep crucial His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and damage new orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , there will appear to be Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for around half the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a pol@@ l by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent dis@@ grun@@ tled . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea beach .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a re @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which specific layers a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , the price is similar to Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noticed . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the forefront here as an exception .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ schüt@@ z in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller was pav@@ ing the way to FC Bayern for a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have created a dream start to the Milan &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ &apos;s hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starting success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; in his 28th place in the Champions League , Müller received good aid from Olympic Games Tor@@ rent Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion conceived as a f@@ lange . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich held word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the league , including prestigious clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they dar@@ ed to go cour@@ age@@ ously , but often to work in their offensive endea@@ vors . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by playing on the left side of Douglas Costa , who rarely passed through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; at first , as an Olympic champion , Ide@@ ye Brown stroke the Pole of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct receipt , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; even though the Bav@@ arians were accustomed to play a dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could put on needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
but on door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was in@@ let .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ a about the l@@ at de@@ fle@@ ction ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , guar@@ ola allowed to defend a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario i@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Her@@ o has given the green light only after the final training , sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first change , Guardian decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ ler Müller put on one . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partially war@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the followers of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was taken ab@@ rup@@ tly from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smoke , do not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; good news : at ren@@ unciation , the risk is quickly reduced . &quot;
smokers have a much increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 atten@@ de@@ es .
&quot; major causes of tooth failure are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , accentu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ ke Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people of being non @-@ smokers , study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of lack of denti@@ stry , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet the rem@@ nants of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhine River
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a technical department for archaeological excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman is caught up by freight train
&quot; after a young woman has arrived at the train station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ ges ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern &quot; , &quot; the Federal Police is asking the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , she suffered grave injuries from the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated locally and brought to a hospital by rescue staff .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal tra@@ vers@@ ing of the young woman there are no re@@ aliz@@ ations to the intermedi@@ ary officials .
the incident was possibly witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; there are residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;
&quot; information about the cause of the accident , can be given around the clock and given free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8@@ or any other police station . &quot;
EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to raise the dispute over the proposed TTIP free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by means of the TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is expected to rise to 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment tri@@ bunal .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; until now , the parties involved agreed on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past months , it became clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment tri@@ bunal in accordance with its own data . &quot;
&quot; for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings demanded mainly by large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judge , on which companies can enforce claims for damages on tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act identified the European Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; by contrast , the German state secretary Matthias Mahl@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a big step forward . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of the reform , the Commission considered essential points that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association for Business Europe warned against limiting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; until now , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pin . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost moved by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he talks about various places , which he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ est and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they were created and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has been proving to be a wonderfully creative person . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but at any time into great opul@@ ent drift . &quot;
the rum@@ our of &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ av@@ ed series : each of the 50 states of the US should be sung in a row .
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and had a positive surprise . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , 2005 , a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any net list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic components . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ti@@ dy studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage dé@@ cor . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens tou@@ red Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens that has become much more mature turns back to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the band plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can basically disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; record in the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens sings modest , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ án &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ b@@ án &apos;s debut is expected at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ m@@ mage with tension . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , the new Labour leader , will make his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ gs and set up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch and his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs from close quarters .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because after his appointment she will be a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several articles in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; in dis@@ respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; &quot; within Labour , namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour will present changes to remove the whole idea of a bo@@ unds altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Assistant and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the dis@@ patch box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , said that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas to Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ er is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will be subjected to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also got the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch &quot; theatre , which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted he failed . &quot;
&quot; being broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and required extensive reforms . &quot;

Po@@ und rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound was jumping off according to data showing an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid objective of SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and advanced assessment of the date of an interest rate increase . &quot;
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after acquisition of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v entered . &quot;
&quot; one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and combine brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining company said that he had taken 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the reporting company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber in the capital : at Bi@@ eber &apos;s expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; 21 years young , a han@@ di@@ cap with flu@@ ffy FR@@ IS@@ E . &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
just like Wik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the construction of the Bi@@ eber : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives will cost exactly as much the day as her m@@ um E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wik@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fill you with a dream , &quot;
school attendance ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
even Bi@@ eber himself does not .
it has already taken care of .
&quot; he assi@@ sts three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company , spending many , many dollars on the bi@@ eber account . &quot;
&quot; and with each doll which looks like he and over the counter , Bi@@ eber also cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one gaz@@ es at the wind@@ screen . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million people .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
&quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is just in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; on number 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t care about the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanese on a Pot@@ ato idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; these are both - namely in the Pot@@ ato Bo@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger tak@@ e@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the expression &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer served in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Lebanese idea came to the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; like lots of meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to give away . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the international understanding of international understanding is well received . &quot;
met@@ cash launches campaign for the fight against al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ amor@@ and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailer sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley appreciated that I@@ GA retailers might lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business , and in volumes on a high fixed @-@ cost base , could cost some 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ amor@@ us entered into contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction at equal pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
the wholes@@ aler however resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to compare sale prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to supply I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and to deliver a better choice of private label foods .
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief business spokes@@ man Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs will be put to El@@ an , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in four years for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented du@@ os , who is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight due to the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice through the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ting : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth to second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite un@@ en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he sm@@ ashed a thu@@ g when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision , which starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and ear@@ ns all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and adher@@ ed to all who tried to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants arrived at a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution rather than a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ block at a disputed meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stand , which was run on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country would also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed at the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that has ar@@ isen through mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said the government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also joined two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos shifted the main crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to drive there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
Clinton has a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates but these projections have decreased .
&quot; their support for the men has decreased mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders just returned with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has wan@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic constitu@@ encies of the pres@@ election nation@@ ally say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
it is also quoted to deal with the problems and the elec@@ ti@@ bility .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the president &apos;s office in the balance sheet , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not . &quot;
&quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead over S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for the elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries would be unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den views maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts best in hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about a quarter of the voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during ten@@ ure as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that there is no overall impact on their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse . &quot;
&quot; these are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the elec@@ torate do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of eligible voters will also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good notes , however . &quot;
&quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards Sally rather than hon@@ esty , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; the two candidates meanwhile account for half of the voters &quot; support in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp nationwide throughout the country . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ y , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell down the deepest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin of the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - with 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest pol@@ l from ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; overlooking a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathroom temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; swimming temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a dis@@ miss@@ al ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people are submitted . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target across a frozen ground . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches and then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to hospital .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Police She@@ er@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g were repeatedly added to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs repeatedly with dum@@ b force . &quot;
&quot; many families have been destroyed by the br@@ otherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charge on murder of the third count for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a rise in interest is coming , and the land@@ se will be shaken , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could notice that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a higher interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at too low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets are depreci@@ ated 12 to 24 months after initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a newer study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest increase , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally occur later in the raising cycle and the return of return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 interest increases since 1950 only nominal GDP was below 4.5 per cent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed to interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent chance . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the raising cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ arks very quickly placed after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bor@@ rowing , the yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields are falling immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring higher yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , lending has increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large companies , which handle the larger part of their business activities in the US , will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to respond exceedingly positive three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of the pure stock of shares , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers want to see profits through higher yields , even if experts differ in different opinion how quickly that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament Col@@ lins , Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , picked up the voice from The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private person does not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; ver@@ du@@ ous &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which was under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice , the BBC &apos;s musical talent show which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sts that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there is an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday stopped spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that now there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only show 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales journal . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
but now this comm@@ utes and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
last year five times the average number of buyers tou@@ red their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was found out that out of £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 was spent online .
&quot; in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at crane accident Get@@ ting to Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia ham@@ pers the collapse partly of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
&quot; sad @-@ filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect , when the first of the dead presented their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the procession proc@@ eeded at the holy place , where only days before a building crane r@@ ushed through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell onto the bed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king handed down a san@@ ction to Bin Laden &apos;s building company because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed , when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , was supported by the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already agreed that the H@@ add@@ haf@@ i will continue to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to go to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which collap@@ sed into an inner courtyard of the mega @-@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group did not make any statements about the collapse de the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project run by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia Master &apos;s Family for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a back@@ sli@@ dden son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; government representatives ordered that 1 Million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed , and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other wounded get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss claims that the time of cheap East European tra@@ des@@ people is over
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has stepped behind
&quot; this leads to the opening of 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans &quot;
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is alleged that Brit@@ ons set up their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans , who carry out the work in their home . &quot;
&quot; if you are clever@@ ly b@@ yp@@ assed with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe has now out@@ dated services to low prices . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at professionals and 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are met by women . &quot;
at the moment the men were predomin@@ ant .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift it more strongly to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also instructed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company owned by 50 percent of the team , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group owed the costs for closing the shops . &quot;
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public spending on Wednesday at Kla@@ gen@@ furt . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted of this reproach in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in preliminary investigation that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 were used mon@@ ies from club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the Chair of the Sho@@ op@@ ener Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was created to the association . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials only had compens@@ ations for expense and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities were in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we lead the club further or do we lock ourselves ? &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read @-@ based corporate audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have put money up@@ stream , our life assur@@ ances have been put as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; he said during the recording . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed upon : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of financial success , compensation for compensation payments was decided retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense damage was paid out only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; as a result , l@@ ump and no @-@ detail adjustments seemed to be possible , explained the former chairman of the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts administered the two accused , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial bund@@ ling , it is important that only the freedom of debt has been , the answer . &quot;
&quot; an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account in 2011 against the one function@@ ary for official abuse . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , decl@@ aring the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account expi@@ red on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; after that , the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time . &quot;
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed that the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage compensation . &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor want to know . &quot;
&quot; on this , the first defend@@ ant declared that he had not agreed with this wording , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ eting , he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants could not provide precise documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept , according to a factory test , where everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the o@@ dom@@ eter .
&quot; all the exercises were done in cash , and he said in his statement that he had to travel to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his home country to the bank . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard reaches further 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to staff cuts running for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will have further jobs in the division of the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ er Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the company intends to save costs of USD 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share declined 2.3 % on the stock exchange .
&quot; with printers from California , Pal@@ o Alto , the company is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be pool@@ ed in a new company - separated from the promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a new dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand by corporate customers in accordance with its services , set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
this resulted in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted that customers will increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and get more and more shops right online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would largely fall to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
&quot; that other states are flying air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 per cent are positive . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 per cent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of press at 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
&quot; at the heart of the trade fair stand up to 27 September networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; Mobility Connec@@ ts &quot; &quot; officially on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can attend the IA@@ A from Saturday .

Ger@@ se@@ kar@@ á@@ t : detached house in a village with a lake
&quot; on the Serbian border , the Hungarian police used tear gas and water @-@ laun@@ chers against several hundreds of displaced refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the breaking point of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and a water @-@ ro@@ cket was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially put an un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
the police then used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have withdrawn from now on .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees sl@@ umped together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves if the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates have been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view that F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and that interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alizing interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Chief Operating Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global proportions . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets to stop raising , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
Delta State University fears of ap@@ ology
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he shot his colleagues on the day and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , He shot a man and killed a man . &quot;
lamb spoke to the staff of the emergency call center that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb crossed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb had supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ l had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was created by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ fic had a daughter , 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ erly was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss has been working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ cements , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them he did not go to prison .
&quot; as police officers took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , he drove his car to the side , fled at foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a PhD from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .

Lufthansa is planning a large group remo@@ del@@ ing .
the Lufthansa Group intends to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; in 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world , corporate restructuring will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union . &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and deplo@@ ys the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the focus of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year , resulting from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger &apos;s business . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the future , CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Euro@@ wings for Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt . &quot;
&quot; with the new presentation , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphasizes the importance of Euro@@ wings , which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employee was complex . &quot;
&quot; airline company operated under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflic@@ ting conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the court stopped . &quot;
this divided the union .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; cockpit wanted to come as quickly as possible to viable results . &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , the background is the &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa will out@@ source routes to the Euro@@ wings group &apos;s own budget line . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to weeping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w went into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being admitted to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s horrible - a boy , who comes to Manchester United with 18 , has it very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then the six months will last , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card have mat@@ ured .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ aller .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost in@@ war@@ dly . &quot;
unless you are maybe David Cameron .
&quot; when asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental issue published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ stores a summary of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that was not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly as follows : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who had not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing street speaker said the text was probably coming from Camer@@ ons &apos;s constitu@@ ent office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re selected for the tour UK , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not be able to make an ou@@ tri@@ ght victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ring of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
based on this message : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; long ago it would have been extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , when he turns out further acquisitions for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss engaged his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ o got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play on and off .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a drummer I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those obtained before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ hand man has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s chief of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ en , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you need to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a dol@@ drums by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets into trouble with each day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always with its own debt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if it end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gre@@ ats , then come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes an out@@ sider UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened for the exagger@@ ated long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ aded force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine that they are going to pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan useful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense , and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , however , that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones chi@@ ppers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ Indians most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about them , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the not adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor . &quot;
the press never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly flap on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s - a mistake then and today .
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wild don@@ or of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ and@@ alism may well say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the sc@@ out sc@@ outs in him fought , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be dis@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell told his comrades and depu@@ ties after all reports on their convention evening .
&quot; whatever the br@@ ush@@ ly bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe , allowing him to keep laboratories supporting in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste any political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be point@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose CEO had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , said they . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting announced to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding which he should have received after reports beforehand by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include an industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work is sign@@ alled that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he Report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted earlier . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said the broadcasting fees should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC six years in his time with Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to hold the broadcasting fees , which I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least make its production on programs that others do not make or order . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad a support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme could be financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC show what former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders were to be sold . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcast charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they place them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I call on you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think we all think that one gets a great value here for £ 150 a year , but for people who are £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an mission &quot; , &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only a few of BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; to the question of part@@ n@@ ering , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on TV are shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by out@@ bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
impulses work by turning on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; th@@ read@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani asser@@ ted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscop@@ ic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
&quot; sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels , activating the cells they are assigned to , such as a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ onen . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain by an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; Give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly ner@@ v@@ ingly up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , if and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people do .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people get dressed and their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ ors : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through B@@ aking .
&quot; as you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have made you a little . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bro@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; poorly @-@ mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to lie dor@@ man@@ t when they kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , adding a dish@@ washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they shouldn &apos;t make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only a matter of being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall asked her neighbours if they were doing something to make the drum and bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbors sleeping two hours before leaving their own music , shut their door and went to their three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very aw@@ k@@ ward if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , dis@@ connect and then see each day and maybe see how all common friends are moving over to them ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot co@@ hab@@ itation is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your subordin@@ ate a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys left in his un@@ locked room , the limit between an el@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding , place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
lock your door and place your keys in a glass of water that will put you in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions at the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , ear@@ ners &quot;
real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses in the middle of the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the single mother and the ling@@ ering servant . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how you can build cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how rapidly cheaper housing can be created : he builds on a project of terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers , or sports halls has no sustainability . &quot;
for the people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ bert : a semi @-@ detached house needs a f@@ ew@@ est place .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when one under@@ scores the people in blocks of living .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily converted to the specific needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction had taken six months .
this is reasonable .
have the building rules complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ bert : I have successfully passed my project on a legal basis .
especially complicated is the threat of the Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking place ordin@@ ance .
have a lot of fun .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : there were those , which accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
what definitely is not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : it &apos;s true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that hardly could afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ loving mother or the ling@@ ering @-@ servant . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how you can build cheap and well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , typing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message stating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may be the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
it is worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; in the fight for the World Cup title , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto in the fight for the World Cup title against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; I have nothing more to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday of defending champion and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on has won seven of the 12 season races so far and will also attack the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; for days a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; Schach@@ club Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member in his ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which chairman Alfred Klein accepted . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players not able to record the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
&quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot;
lod@@ g@@ ings in search of direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ center Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office recently opened .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seekers will receive information on questions such as care insurance or health and care insurance benefits . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been setting up with our out@@ patient nursing service that often car@@ egi@@ vers can be left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; the new land@@ lady Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ dine and the citizen &apos;s hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; explained the fact that the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the Senior Center for Care and Care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both business leaders especially in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
&quot; moreover , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also devoted itself to the association &apos;s association at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
this makes the Social Foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ old passed away
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus on Tuesday communicated . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as stated in the broadcast . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury chamber in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the refurb@@ ishment of the Lob@@ ko@@ witz palace to the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;
gar@@ rison : Tim Wiese creates a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese has been noticed in Bremen .
&quot; foot@@ ball@@ ers once was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ als keeper in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he did not get intellectual . &quot;
&quot; in the inner city of Bremen , the meadow had just cut the hair , when he saw a parking gar@@ rison exhibited a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; after that , Wiese went out of the store , insul@@ ted the cler@@ k and threw her in front of the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reports . &quot;
&quot; the city of Bremen confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
only then will I decide whether a meadow will be shown or not .

men beating over 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft fuel station .
there were also three people on the grounds of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men cried out to the young man , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg@@ ged rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dropped out of his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a car right up to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a beat @-@ stick , one beat on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured one had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; so far , there is only a vag@@ ue daily description . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

&quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of Fel@@ res@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen .
&quot; Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economic Affairs , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ res@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel &apos;s reti@@ ring goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing on the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the rock out@@ casts met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their specialist education in the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I just called it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees himself to be his own boss . &quot;
and so you agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in frac@@ tions of frac@@ tions .
&quot; there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunte@@ ered in the D@@ RK @-@ readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ res@@ ausen operates as a primary doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as doctors . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 Euros will be donated to the land@@ fill as part of a funding program from the District ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; says Bernd Bor@@ mann , vice @-@ president . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ lows each quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are about 500 in North German average practice . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor was found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; whoever visits Müll@@ ers speaking hours , by the way , still looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen . &quot;
they already feel a little sad@@ ness after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients for sure , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
your husband adds laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself in front of gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also going up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister for the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum is &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people in the foreground .
&quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; that there is a need for clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , this was not the case with Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially towards Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia would not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted to walk past T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is predominantly Syrian and Afgh@@ an , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were re@@ directed to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which so far led migrants to the Hungarian border , heading towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that makes people attempt to include certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been traveling through Serbia all night away from the 500 kilometers distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there could actually be a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed consistently a good certificate concerning the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to appe@@ ase Wednesday at a local evi@@ denti@@ ary in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , premature . &quot;
it would not be a very high number of refugees at present .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or any other country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps showing alternative routes through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as business wire , marketing hard@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der affairs will have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the event continued .
most of the defend@@ ants came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted out both in the United States and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce in Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively business around the Mannheim site .
&quot; people do their worries , some fast pac@@ ed , partly cozy bum@@ ps . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the parade ground .
urban railways keep .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life at stunning autumn sunshine and in the midst of it four large panels , each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce , with this action , drew attention to its 20 years of existence and is entirely confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe system is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteer workers .
&quot; while a pass@@ ant spontaneously reaches the chal@@ k and adds &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of the world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the de@@ ac@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped many people open up . &quot;
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral and mourning staff belong to the volunteer workers of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was calling for volunteers by calling , she immediately contacted and was there at the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and family members in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
they are all well trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her task and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another point of view , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and denom@@ in@@ ation@@ ally independent .
&quot; the financial support provided by the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training , education and supervision of the funeral and funeral directors . &quot;
trainings for new employees are offered every two years .
&quot; the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the supply giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts . &quot;
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 per cent on average and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher aggregates for bo@@ d@@ road transport of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted starting in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of the growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid income &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vacation jobs were announced one day later than the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted 12 of Z@@ acks Investment Research &apos;s analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts forecast $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping which brought the sales in its Un@@ ity Express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ port transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher earnings because of higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;

the map is a reminder that the leader Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests ahead of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. jobs and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented stimulus through the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist of the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel , Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted this week &apos;s interest rate .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Rate j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her declaration in order to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improving on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives stated that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world paid together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Rate fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would reduce global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , with Dow falls by almost 10 % below May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il affects the complex calculation when it is to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn &apos;t occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke that was at that time in 2013 that F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ier , author@@ itative member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who uses for a higher interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il did not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she fears a rise in interest because the markets thri@@ ve , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I do not think it should advance the time . &quot;

Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to explain how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , recent research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can neg@@ atively influence the immune system . &quot;

the municipality of Bern@@ ried allowed the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ looking gym@@ nasi@@ um construction at the &quot; &quot; Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ welt &quot; &quot; move forward step by step : in the recent joint council meeting , the completed construction work was unanim@@ ously secured without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Board had also decided to apply for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan , among other things . &quot;
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special shape regarding roof construction .
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof top &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; again the ti@@ lt , which for energy reasons - is stipulated differently than in the development plan , should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan with respect to the ti@@ lt did not permit &quot; exceptions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um construction at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
&quot; in the next stage of operation , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the District Office for testing . &quot;
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this is the supervisory board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
&quot; for the next two years , fisher@@ man should work with his team if the supervisory board agrees to the two houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the hospital in Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , res@@ igned ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference room psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer of the Qu@@ asi reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; positively and very understand@@ ably &quot; received by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are called for tonight ( 20.@@ 15 PM ) on the HC scene .

Jag@@ oration with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
after firing a gun a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
&quot; at first , it was not clear how exact it could happen to the accident . &quot;
the crimin@@ ality is determined by the police .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
a suspect has led the police to the dead 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for the last Saturday .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old had to kill the young people and cast their corp@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police ha@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old who was arrested on Tuesday evening was also considered to be a suspect and the investig@@ ator lead to the discovery site of the corp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning , after an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
in the search for a young woman investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
&quot; in the event of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the authorities reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the corp@@ se was put into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be brought to the jail on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put death on him . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable residence .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built each year by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the association of con@@ domini@@ ums &quot; Social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is going to launch a housing shortage that will grow from year to year .
&quot; at present , some 77@@ ,000 units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compla@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people lived in large cities in flat @-@ room flats . &quot;
young adults remained un@@ intentionally longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has dropped again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; suggests a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing development . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the transfer tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed housing could be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the alliance demands attractive tax depreci@@ ation options . &quot;
the sponsor@@ ship programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have already been accessed on Monday evening . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia direct corridor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no passing through , since more and more refugees are choosing the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to Slov@@ ene Minister of Inter@@ nal Affairs and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the sealing off the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees sailed to Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had set off its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there were people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the border of Serbia as part of Croatia &apos;s neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot via the green border . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t meet barriers . &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , little more refugees come after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 armed men . &quot;
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed &apos;s southern border town . &quot;
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; &quot; established at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees arrested .
&quot; practically , however , no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people left on the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording sessions in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still living in the country according to government figures . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the on@@ ward journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the vac@@ ations after the bridge celebration on Sunday , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to take the train to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Na@@ he Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we took the hop@@ eful guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them by car to Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to hand a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was shut off before the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing generally is high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of assisting R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially taken over the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
the protagon@@ ists of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; even the refugees will have to notice that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which has invited them and welcomed it , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protecting victims . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ fixed quarters &quot;
&quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has to do all hands fully . &quot;
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first tak@@ eover centre .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without a great deal , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad pays with a need of 85@@ ,000 quarters per year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
these would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it works well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ atory supports Konrad .
&quot; there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born tomorrow , and will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator will also expect great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot;
yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that lod@@ g@@ ings must have a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the duties .
&quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , that he was more successful in placing accommodation , Konrad gave reasons for his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cost the republic , as they themselves stated . &quot;
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
&quot; up to now , his own district search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz is asking for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be checked for their suitability . &quot;
critic@@ isms of the chief of the city on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced on Monday the further procedure in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the relevant border controls . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; however , the protective seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria is now introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans for &quot; &quot; P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the restructuring of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line has been officially concluded .
&quot; the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building , while the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Cra@@ ft and later acquiring them .
&quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented and for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second store in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old bearer of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she now gained an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the store , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the deciding factor for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the big area Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been brought to the cra@@ dle from her mother .
&quot; most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so some woman gets into rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the specialist will not be able to answer her last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of each outfit is recycled .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are named An@@ ders .
&quot; some people also connect this feature with billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for purification .
&quot; whether he expresses alien@@ ation@@ ally , as far as journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy , the candidate for the US presidential bure@@ au whi@@ r@@ ls up the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ ouses is a term to many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village is related to it over -@@ zig quarters .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sprit@@ es , among which besides Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to the word &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to High German : the investors , says it . &quot;
&quot; so , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of investors . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a store for gold graves in the USA . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked testim@@ onies of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was born , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ ancing the American , &quot; he is always so angry . &quot;
does he think that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension agent Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stadt residents , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz @-@ family donated a visit to the church organ during a visit , which is generally well @-@ arrived . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; you would find it better if he didn &apos;t make the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who saw the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would have never been there . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ m@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels Film , for the Tru@@ mp long inter@@ viewed , saw 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA arous@@ ed interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the National Park of Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den received the award for Sustainable Tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts on the reviews for Today . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull succ@@ um@@ bed to the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , the gap to Sunrise has been closed in the last few months . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40.000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September , Sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial killer of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average 44@@ 6.000 visitors . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the ratings of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ests show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have unknow@@ ingly revealed who The b@@ achel@@ or wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at whom Sam Wood ends in The Bachelor , is sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may accidentally have a clu@@ e on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood with@@ holds his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a game cor@@ rup@@ ter who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay told her that the house@@ visit made her clear last week that wood could be &quot; the one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked what Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have called Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka like the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday did 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by team @-@ team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his rap@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ tu@@ ger warned of a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools ahead of collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get inv@@ ali@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s parliament postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; in fact , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ v@@ inists called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it won &apos;t go any further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria postpon@@ es , others do not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy in the big wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; ( CS@@ U ) at 47 gym@@ nasi@@ ums for three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ v@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 has to be spe@@ eded up , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on jumps
the German stock market is closed with winn@@ ings after a long @-@ distance and nervous account history .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a firm start of the US exchanges gave a clear direction that ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points . &quot;
&quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;

solid profits also posted net trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted approximately 1 percent in plus . &quot;
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to appear on this Friday until after the end of the interest rate decision in the US and also in the event of great deterioration .
the discussion about the load from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the RW@@ E shares down to a record low and also left deep marks on E@@ on .
&quot; according to Spiegel , German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures stated in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.3 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report of the U.S. investor magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; had a positive impact on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; thus , investors paid little attention to the German chip maker . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were set off than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers from the Daimler and BMW car@@ makers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen &apos;s advantages increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market the return on stock exchange securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the League @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the Euro rate declined in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) USD . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , head of the district officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them cast stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used tear gas and shot them in the air before res@@ or@@ ting on rubber floors .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear immediately why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known from which they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s Southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rig@@ i say that new provinces which are formed under the proposed new constitution will reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the arus that want a separate state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature resolved this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution might enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
urban area planned in the city
the plot of the Em@@ der Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a land of about 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; we wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor may be questioned is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have yet been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Street , already purchased a few months ago and demol@@ ished the building on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor created publicly plans for the project for the first time .
some li@@ eger are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their free holiday fu@@ gi@@ um

now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are lying on the table .
&quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Construction , &quot; unveiled its plans for the first time on Monday evening at the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , accused of investors and managing sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ lessly proc@@ eeded to the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction called out heavy reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cla@@ p that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus@@ loads to get that , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com will be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war torn by the war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of losing weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if lightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are mor@@ bid obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this operation declined from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , diabetes is completely dissolved only at one percent , and in some cases by just about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , reflecting the blood glucose levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is believed to be below 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , said researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring to people with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reverse is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently paying attention to fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main occupational author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide also called for the end of violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and stated that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the path to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of recei@@ pts of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room , &quot; Lop@@ ez CN@@ N said . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ iny on social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially with small children , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p around whis@@ ky but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes from Stra@@ w@@ berry Sen@@ ften@@ a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was put into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , considered to be drunk by an adult , said Dr Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah left her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had met her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the hi@@ cc@@ ups of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities staff assume that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by submitting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; the police regarded the en@@ listed plan as &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ ri@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; and referred to the school authority by disciplinary measures . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in the case of a rear @-@ end collision between the Nordr@@ ing and the Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ p@@ liers in the direction of the industrial area and noticed too late that at the round@@ about had stopped two driving vehicles .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the event of accidents involving accidents of about 10,000 euros , the police co @-@ operate . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Audi was no longer prepared and had to be tow@@ ed off .

&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was refused by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of tit@@ le@@ competition in Scottish football fre@@ es Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers middle fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic music as there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a messenger for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic Games any more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars di@@ dy@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic fought , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen was followed by a five @-@ point advantage , which now stands at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had bad times already , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel that way - but we must continue .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
now standing together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases overall in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July with 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people with no work for the UK as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as demonstrated by the National Statisti@@ cs Bureau ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except in late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have been better articul@@ ated , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I am doing . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ingham , a repor@@ ter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go here again on all the details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would justify him to be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

&quot; I had to say nothing about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk about the main one and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - whom I will design@@ ate when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy said at Rac@@ ing@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to seize me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L treat cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now reflect upon it . &quot;
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the unt@@ apped Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the day @-@ to @-@ day treatment principle &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day like that .
but it had also so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was handed over to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man came from Nath@@ alia to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged for driver &apos;s cur@@ bs and lowered assistance and other transport charges .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy breaks against ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; of two Premier League F@@ av@@ our@@ ites of N@@ RL . &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm winning in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a few covered comment about the Storm team after his team won the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended his team &apos;s tac@@ kling and said that they were only concentrating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident , as it means they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has made the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne talking about exciting football .
&quot; he played his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a bull@@ sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we look forward to as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like them . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm played against R@@ oo@@ sters a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ auses and do not points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them at a stage . &quot;
the Storm team was free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bians with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction &quot;
&quot; a man who may have a life @-@ long penalty threat@@ ens to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ accused in the yacht port during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life imprisonment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that could have been in the café for a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damage deposit , under the conditions that he left his Australian and his Serbian pass , reported to the police every day and with@@ stood to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab breaking apart
&quot; at a rear @-@ end collision with three lor@@ ries on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to switch to the left in the last moment , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
the cab of the accident @-@ caus@@ er tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage amounting to 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es for sending images
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he fell asleep in an online mess@@ aging service by which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it and found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed their mother .
&quot; the police looked after the five images , then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer were done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said that he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty in the sense of the indictment , to denoun@@ ce in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his disappearance .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael con@@ tends the verdict by October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; in this case Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other cases pending . &quot;
he was still included in the sexual offen@@ se directory before the judgment date .
Schle@@ user switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are being taken up by the German @-@ Austrian border aside from major control points .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people on smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river B@@ order Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise of Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they had reached the German side on foot via bridges and wei@@ rs .
they are taken at reception by Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; in comparison to the start of the week , the Munich central station entered again significantly more refugees compared to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; just before 8@@ am , some 700 people arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the last few days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance District with bows of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour is to be expected . &quot;
on Friday you can see the sun again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , the compact cars are to be seen , which are currently selling very well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel introduces a start below the largest competitor , VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse can offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault wins the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen only as a fifth in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in the segment .
the Nissan designers aim to find their position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s indications of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand at the front panel : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the ris@@ ked Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice Minister of Justice , which has been housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison quarters between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on his own feet after his lawyer &apos;s claim , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his position of office because of the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied conditions of detention against the State of Berlin was indeed sh@@ attered .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court rev@@ oked the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re@@ viewing it . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity har@@ med .
chamber court decides now on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of prison sentences were author@@ itative for the compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money damage .
the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; only in April they spoke of a det@@ ain@@ ee to claim damages , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ reasonable . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin constitutional court that an in@@ mate in a parallel case had confirmed a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged in a similar cell for three months in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines in the last weeks due to lack of staff .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always trapped for 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness increases , even to skir@@ m@@ ishes it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 shall fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is going on in Germany ?
&quot; according to the report by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany will even be able to accept a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the extraordinary challenge of determination : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the shortage of living space is dramatic , but above all in paid rental objects : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments are out of the price of rent , and for these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister for Agriculture Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding , currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; far too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( IAB ) , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society of admission , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Sch@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to the German government , there has been a political shift in Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees in recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement that asylum seekers have limited to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view has mostly prevailed that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often conveyed by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is based on the view from the royal path to the integration of labour . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ rooted parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nonetheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for instance by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German are prepared in the classroom . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate Gat@@ wick from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German student movement estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state banned asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has abandoned his position . &quot;
Studi@@ er@@ wil@@ fully refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or des@@ ul@@ ment do not receive any services according to the asylum application law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in general , the latter do not receive af@@ e , as they do not fall under the circle of authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards this gap will be reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this funding gap must be closed , demanding Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get af@@ e .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essively swe@@ ep the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state church right into a new state religion ratio . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organisation which takes care of newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also belong to duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant a certain amount of control . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the willingness to face religious fundament@@ alism is also part of this . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to extra@@ vert such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism becomes more urgent . &quot;
&quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general equality law for nearly a decade . &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organizations and non @-@ white Germans call for a long time and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention of Germany commit , must become a reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the previously anticipated refugees , writes the president of the chair Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is demanding to hand out health cards to all newcom@@ ers . &quot;
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited scope of services that the asylum application law stipul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors are above all doing the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; they do not only need to be taken over in clinics , but also in medical practices . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would have been helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , for example , there are more un@@ treated disabilities , and with young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; but with the partly other diseases , German doctors would come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the medical don@@ ka , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable to vulnerable refugee children . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who are suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fears of death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , severe fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z said . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; Passion &quot; production , Circus Pro@@ bst res@@ h@@ apes to the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to attract every age group into the spell of intrigu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst re@@ charges in the Man@@ ege on the tile . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for lovers is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ itus with world @-@ city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus is convincing with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban Duo would like to loose it loose . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous sal@@ mons , the Acro@@ b@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility . &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He y@@ uan there is no problem .
fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atic as little others and fascin@@ ates with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are very often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst has a position : &quot; it is not good for our animals .
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read from the eyes upon the possibility of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege . &quot;
the upper@@ most command therefore : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst , from September 17 @-@ 20 , invites you to his performances daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe has a wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
&quot; last month , they had expelled him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them of interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that the immunity in the Parliament ends , and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &apos;s party is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30.000 work@@ stations
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to develop 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP leader and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot;
&quot; it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill , Hewlett and Dave Packard , to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was named &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to handle the turn@@ around from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely @-@ focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation run according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ism scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain at the European Championship . &quot;
the great shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone not well @-@ healed .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognizes , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 157 players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an early period of time , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win martial arts , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep balance and give the players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go on through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest timi@@ dity in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven by far @-@ away hopes of leading the association to his first European Cup . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends once so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , focusing on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the Beau@@ tiful at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football look in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing told me , &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ inflic@@ ted has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when one speaks openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to gr@@ ind Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ mund Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mund Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince parking stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion on their way , but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schacht@@ ur@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris Team after his injury , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 Draw on their own site against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he ran in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he passed Johan Wil@@ and passing nicely into the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a Play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ dri@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fosten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes referred to , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started him after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he put his fellow players into play , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a spin that was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus obtained his sixth Se@@ ason Pass after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all thinking that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi identified a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
&quot; mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sales as part of its huge debt collection plan . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about $ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of rights to rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange at the beginning of Wednesday morning .
&quot; the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion dollar stock sales last week as part of the more extensive plans to til@@ ise around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent reduction on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per cent of the group .
&quot; concerns about a long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping visit in Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month and confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday .
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and respon@@ ds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

&quot; XI , whose visit was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on their way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi approached a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying on China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern 2008
world champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times championship winners , four times champion Champions League winners , twice world champion , twice world champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he stood before the European Championship in 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that is also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship .
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he has got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would be running with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , turned the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film production
matt Dam@@ on confronted the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ mined the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments of The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the tweet earned more than 5,000 retri@@ ever@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement maintained nationwide effect and urged the leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against far@@ med livel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; in February , Prince Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black ones , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ s first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge every three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 dollars or have been living , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , didn &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received a lot of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad F@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon upright his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three rounds .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ bar , and therefore I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit game , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the slaugh@@ ter@@ house , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ bar , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh string , the T@@ wins had their best chance of coming back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon provided his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier for Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy out@@ walked the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust a Two @-@ Run to the righ@@ th@@ man Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bass player Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th edition of the Major League for the 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe played a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ hand man stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three rings in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been eliminated from the game from the injury list after having been missing more than a month for a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the lead off the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ook gave a single to Second Lie@@ uten@@ ant Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos succeeded with a single on the right side , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count and scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a Walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the Wur@@ m@@ schul@@ er .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z es@@ hip in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder bite , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris will be removed from the vulner@@ ability to compete against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing from the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees should join in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 pending refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this eventu@@ ality in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they should then be distributed to other local authorities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , after the initial admission of the presi@@ ding presi@@ ding presi@@ ding of the presi@@ ding presi@@ dency , a total of 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective departure . &quot;
four years ago we had been glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; now the conflict ends crashing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister for Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement on which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner ; there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
he did not call them concrete figures and pointed out discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route . &quot;
their goal is usually Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week . &quot;
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new trial for a binding distribution of additional 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the Con@@ federation aims to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , that Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would need protection , also complain . &quot;
those who do not have a lead @-@ eye view could not stay in Germany either .
this view was clearly shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from going over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut through the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants have made their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the iron anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean s@@ nat@@ ches . &quot;
this concludes by researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange movement is only small , but too big for a permanently fixed heavenly body , it is said in a Communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( United States State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers presented their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; as early as 2006 , Cass@@ ini had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ ies the steam and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 for several weeks
&quot; the 1860 München must rel@@ inqu@@ ish Val@@ det R@@ ama , an offen@@ se actor for about a month . &quot;
an investigation gave an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave the association .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ald loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of a united professionals . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the Six@@ ties presented initially a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
at the moment Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week following his conc@@ ussion .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to embar@@ k on running training . &quot;
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a violent clas@@ h on his head . &quot;
&quot; contrary to his first fears , he remained without a serious blow . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but those who want to pay attention to its slim line , they are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them , B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. above all , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruit thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the color of the peel only says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and should be consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , they taste pure or sweet dishes . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS delivers up to 9@@ 5000 aid for Christmas business in the US .
&quot; the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are being looked for .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 assistance for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for Christmas business since last year . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first harvest tower , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öh@@ n , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz broke open on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind bu@@ cks and a drop in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure . &quot;
&quot; on the alpine side of the Alps , the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through the valleys during the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also at over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can occasionally penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ bits of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryers for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ow on the alpine slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , in the next 48 hours , with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has to be expected in the next 48 hours , after the huge amount of rainf@@ all has already occurred in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n leaves the air , as a result a cold front rolls with a powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it gets sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday at the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live in seclu@@ sion from their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; with the square , symbo@@ lically it becomes apparent that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome as a young August@@ iner for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a sin@@ ful man of sins . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ duction .
Hammer Arti@@ sts spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs wrote his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective themes can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt co @-@ worked in his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for whom he has made a subjective @-@ artistic choice of the many themes of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as the Way of the Cross , P@@ ossi@@ ls , commandments or Lord &apos;s Prayer . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house , with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original quote of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts to the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old permits a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the triggers for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing took place already with the cane @-@ stock , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to work that way in order to be able to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern is to return art to more value in a faster time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is embos@@ sed today by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have another desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers slide into the images , let them work , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes that are important to him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the original - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
&quot; plans , found a place , commissioned companies , model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X course , it was over again . &quot;
&quot; there were failures in politics and administration for dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hills deposited , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval is to be received in October , the first joint woman Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will be more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the soccer respon@@ ds to the situation to be p@@ itt@@ led in Germany and sec@@ ures its assistance in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle nobody can say that , that doesn &apos;t matter , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the chan@@ cell@@ or , meeting the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football could and would help .
but the crucial course must set the policy .
the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; declared K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal authorities also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will support the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , Head of Sports , Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we are able to use our soccer powers , no , we need to use our bril@@ liance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary on this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a great community work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their own locations is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the German Federal Government ( DF@@ B ) and the Federal Government . &quot;

&quot; the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bled , was power@@ less , then pulled himself out of the street - he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was there at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the United States , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; Every@@ one can happen this way . &quot; &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you have fallen .

football : B@@ V@@ B without R@@ eus vs Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback made by Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga also in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of its pros , Tu@@ k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its regular eleven position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
thus he announced a change on the position of the door keeper .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of tribal keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les left it open . &quot;
&quot; with high lik@@ el@@ ihood , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ ch R@@ eus , that the final retreat for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , sees mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl re@@ trac@@ eable : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; the automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase on digital radio communications . &quot;
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to be &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to use internationally for example , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; despite this , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads &quot; should not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the value added value in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around EUR 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute , on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not even believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed say that up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the flowing traffic could at least envis@@ age 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good each fourth would leave the car in control under no circumstances .

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : window mannequins , which look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which will be seen at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the other hand , because &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ thei@@ der . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completing an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort was carried out : in order to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material went to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special highlight : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative , fashionable attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
&quot; later on , he later taught himself to design fashion . &quot;
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t afford to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener top as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were produced in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer possible today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener peak , fashion played a bigger role , and was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans on past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not serve ni@@ ches in the textile sector in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already account for half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
private specialist stores and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; today , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , currently to Russia and the USA , is weak@@ ening . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association tries to score points on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery factory in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates an area of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , which must first of all be economically viable , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
at some places the machine sticks small spheres .
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ mann Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to create a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; as a result , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy must open wider out@@ wards to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should engage in attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi &apos;an . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a list of neg@@ atives to control market access , Rel@@ ax@@ ation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment will be identified . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legal business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double its mercury @-@ cut value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus achieve a significantly higher dose of the pesti@@ cide .
&quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch Consumer Health Organization , which has a corresponding EU work draft , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full force against pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve pois@@ oning for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish . &quot;
&quot; big predat@@ ory fish , however , are so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury today that about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would then be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller grav@@ estones such as car@@ p are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous over the food chain especially in car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; small amounts have already been able to cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born lesi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants consist of more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; long @-@ lived and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
