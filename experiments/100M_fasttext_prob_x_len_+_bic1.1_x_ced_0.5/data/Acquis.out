a ) i ) The organisation fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) With@@ out the Community and the States , the Organization of Community and States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; III ) If due to the repeated refusal of the community to agree to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are imp@@ eded by this convention , the Council will discuss the refusal to discuss it with the goal of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the countries concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , in fact , are able to carry out the tasks under their agreement . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged so that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) The protection of industrial secrets and other the inspec@@ tors of the organization for the knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other civil servants , the duties pursuant to this Convention , the relevant provisions of the agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this Convention are concluded with regard to nuclear material , when the community and the organization determine that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able for nuclear activity , which is below the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; the Community noti@@ fies the organisation , in accordance with the provisions of this Convention , the disclosure of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures pursuant to this Convention shall be concluded with regard to nuclear material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which each transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the further core material . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear material , which is subject to this Convention , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association agrees with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the candle material is not used during the duration of the non @-@ use of the preventive measures after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives .
B ) The Organization and the Community make a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the scheme will determine how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is held on the basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or States concerned , and on any disclosure of such material from this state or these states on the ongoing basis . &quot;
&quot; this explains her consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or a hidden knowledge of military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs for each of them to grow from this Convention on the implementation of their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or persons liable to their sovereign power , however , are subject to extraordinary costs as a result of a particular investigation of the organization , the organization reimbur@@ ses these costs , provided that it has been clari@@ fied beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and states make sure that the liability for nuclear damage , including an insurance or other financial certainty , can be utilized in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as on the nationals of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the Community or State is asser@@ ting against the Organization or the Organization against the Community or the State for damages , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident occurring in accordance with this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; according to the review of the relevant information provided by the Director General , the Council is not able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to security measures , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives , may also reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account the measure in which measures have been achieved by the measures used , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the parties concerned is concerned - every justi@@ fiable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , are examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the state concerned to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , a statement of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a measure adopted by the Council shall be disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not negotiated in the negotiating path or by another of the organization , the Community and the States , to submit to a party of arbitr@@ ators , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators ; the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed elect a fifth , who presi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the Community or the Organization may seek the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure should be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ core weapons states , the contracting party of the contract , and are members of the association , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
( II ) If the Community of the Organization notified that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
&quot; a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other on request of one of the parties to change this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all member states of the organization from any change of this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that its procedures are completed for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States are the contracting party of the Treaty .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on procedures to be applied .
&quot; the aim of the preventive measures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the degradation of significant quantities of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence from such a branch by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; for the achievement of the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial in@@ fusion and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the review by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material that is not proven for a certain period under indication of the accuracy limits for the specified amounts is specified . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their checks , the organization makes full use of the association &apos;s safety system after Article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the core material community according to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance areas .
&quot; in the application of its preventive measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures of the following kind will be used and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more specifically determined and useful in the supple@@ mental agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ; &quot;
( B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ating measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures pursuant to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) If the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) has not yet been reached , the Community of the Organization shares the amount and composition of the material unless it is in@@ stituted for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later stage of the core fuel cycle produced in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material that is subject to this Convention is not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , the organisation and community consult each other about the use of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community find that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from securing measures according to this Convention : &quot;
&quot; a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in gram - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ; &quot;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization freed up core material which would otherwise be subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention , provided that the entire material quantity liberated by this article in the States is at no point in time than &quot;
&quot; a ) a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; II ) ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of the enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if liberated key material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for re@@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the Organization of Supp@@ le@@ mentary Dec@@ isions , which are necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in the individual to determine how the procedures set forth in the Convention are to be applied . &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements may be extended or am@@ ended without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 , the organization provides a sum@@ mar@@ ised inventory of the entire core material contained in the States regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this Invent@@ ory based on the following reports and the results of their investigation . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entering into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the designation &quot; &quot; Special Stock account &quot; , &quot; which is made up of the funds which the Member States contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is used by the Organization as administrator of tre@@ u@@ alties and uses ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the transaction account will be separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state , which are payable on demand in the currency of the State at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited in the depos@@ iting point of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two rates ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional voting on the cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance out the transaction account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is intended to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the purpose of the organization funded by the organization , whereby the aim of the agreement is to be considered in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which have already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transactions loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , in the case of ten years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transactions loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts for the payment of this watch are directly linked to the organization that retains them .
&quot; each special transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and who may be the recipient of a special transaction loan at the time of the loan granted . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments from special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount returned in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until complete awar@@ ding of all special transactions loans , the administrator has informed the E@@ EC about the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation and by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of paying the special transaction loan , the administrator has been teaching the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the special transactions loans and the expenses made for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator con@@ veys a detailed account statement of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this statement of account . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the accounts recei@@ vable and the amounts paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States are evident . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time conduct an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or plans financed by special transactions and about any other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the E@@ EC and the organization may not enter into force , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of capital charged by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the general secretary of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the proceedings in question .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organisation .
&quot; this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording being equally binding . &quot;
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 is to be closed to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large trial facility called J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are called &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; as to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is still to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ app@@ ings and to accelerate their respective research work which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable any contracting party to benefit from amal@@ gam@@ ation of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work , unnecessary overl@@ app@@ ings and thus achieve the common objective of this research , i.e. , the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in App@@ endi@@ x I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is expanded or altered after verification by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , they will be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the Association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realised through : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - ex@@ changing the personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical findings of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the scope of this agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association organs , &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom ensures that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of the personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to the Common Market J@@ ET with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , the stat@@ ute of which it accepts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom ensures that Switzerland can become a contracting partner of any treaty whose aim is to be concluded within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement , the organs which are commissioned to carry out the association designated in Article 2 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the association agreement must include the setting up of a steering committee , the representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , carries out this task with respect to all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and sets out their T * activities in the interests of both parties to the common objective defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as the common objective defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the counselling groups created within the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities ask for this . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Group , which provides the VG research proposals with a view to the fact that the funds approved for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task seriously with respect to all research and development work related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the Board of Directors , responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and which is responsible for ensuring the optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out during the programme , will perform this task with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the meetings of all co @-@ ordination committees deployed within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which offer appropriate proposals to the committee of directors for the best possible use of the resources , the personnel , and the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F belongs to the core and energy research representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request from the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission regarding the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions and the preparation of future programs and the definition of its overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at the joint level in the merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the committee of directors , the advisory groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the VG to the urgent action is obligatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
&quot; the representatives of the two parties cooperate in the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom programme , according to this agreement , is fixed annually to an amount that is at the cost of Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint undertaking as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland is transferring an amount to the Common Fir@@ m J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the financial provisions of the stat@@ ute of this joint undertaking . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for financing the work as part of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works , which are made on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount will be fores@@ een for covering the expenditure within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council will pay the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are set in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to ensure Eur@@ atom of duties or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or any objects acquired there may not be issued free of charge or free of charge in this country , except under conditions approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ties are not applicable to he@@ wers and pensions who are paid to these persons .
&quot; the provisions governing the access to the knowledge intended for the association intended for articles 2 , paragraph 1 of the present agreement , are regulated in Articles 14 and 15 of this agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personnel . &quot;
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge , which apply to the participation of Switzerland on the joint enterprise J@@ ET , are governed in Article 14 of this agreement and in the charter of the Common Fir@@ m . &quot;
the right of any contracting party to access the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries in awar@@ ding orders to carry out the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be provided by Switzerland and the individuals or companies that justify access to these knowledge under the same conditions as the Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;

&quot; I instruc@@ t you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the previous one .
I honor to confirm you the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the previous one . &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks submit a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery charges for member countries . &quot;
&quot; even now , however , some conditions have been called , for which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand@@ by credit the BI@@ S would initially assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having to be exceeded a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the event of the opening of the loans as well as for any extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the time of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would have to be negotiated in consideration of the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those applying the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary means even on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could achieve a maximum , which corresponds to the Li@@ bor rate increased by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to express my consent to the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , when banks submit a corresponding application . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to express my consent to the Council of the European Communities .
I honor you to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are agreed as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the quantity specified in fact does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with traditional offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the safeguard clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the access of Argentina to the Community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the entry of new Member States , the Community will change in consultation with Argentina , according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; hereby , the number 5 is taken into account of the exhaus@@ tion rate referred to as the number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned in number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community encounters precau@@ tions so that the shipments of frozen meat are not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation the shipments of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina warran@@ ts compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities specified in this agreement provide export lic@@ ences for the products mentioned under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products originated in Argentina depends on the submission of an export license , which is assigned by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the status of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of import license for the goods consumed .
&quot; it is further stated in implementing regulations that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the Community announces the amounts given for export lic@@ ences ; these data may , if necessary , be en@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee ensures that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the Ten@@ dency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions , which are of importance to the target number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat will be carried out under the agreement not named after the Community . &quot;
the committee addresses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 March .
&quot; the quantity , which is applicable from the entry into force of this agreement , is determined in proportion to the total annual quantity and takes account of the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties prior to 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes made comprehensible to them . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to express the consent of your government to this .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;

&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb &apos;s meat according to the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; following this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the Community &apos;s market for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives assurance that the normal sales of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb will not be affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the annual quantity actually executed does not exceed the fixed quantity . &quot;
the above @-@ mentioned amounts are carried out in traditional offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
the Community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the community &apos;s market .
&quot; if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;

&quot; in particular , the Community encounters precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meats are not under@@ mined due to the implementation of this ordin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties do everything to promote the consumption of she@@ ep@@ skin in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand warran@@ ts compliance with the quantities stated in clause 2 in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) ha@@ em@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured with repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest servo @-@ di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely in the volume of the blood cell in@@ und@@ ulation in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ulation .
&quot; the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series , where a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination appears . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ redness of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or state standard preparation in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be maintained for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the shelf @-@ life tests ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture may penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent continues with the added substance the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .

&quot; the re@@ agents for blood group determination specific to the international exchange should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least as long as an international agreement has come about through a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all levels of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; appropriate samples from all re@@ agents are stored for a long time from the laboratory , until it is likely that the batch can no longer be used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents may not contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; a black printed label can be attached to each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ une blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are destined for use on object carriers according to the Test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;

&quot; in the assignment that it is appropriate to also simplify the transport responsibilities between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a unified management document , &quot;
OF CH@@ AN@@ GE that this Convention may not be interpreted in a way that it ent@@ ails the contracting parties from their obligations from other international conventions -
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transport responsibilities between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform administrative paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a uniform paper ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ arities associated with the goods transport between the parties are provided by a single unit , for which im@@ prints are to be used according to the samples in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the single paper serves as application or paper for export , shipping or import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out the legal provisions applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in case of sole use of the uni@@ formity . &quot;
&quot; - to be asked by the participants , so that they can come upon request in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the parties to apply simplified procedures , even using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned cannot be filed with a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an application must subsequently be filed with the approval of the relevant authorities in order to be subject to periodi@@ c anth@@ ology within the deadline stated by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trade papers instead of uni@@ formity . &quot;
&quot; if the single paper is used , the parties concerned with the consent of the competent authorities may add common lists related to export and import@@ ation instead of the supple@@ mental sheets in the trade common lists in which the goods are described . &quot;

&quot; - allowing the competent authorities to enter the data required for the provision of the relevant form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of applications , and , if necessary , without giving a written notification ; &quot;
&quot; allow the competent authorities to see in case of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the registration , that the export , dispatch or import notification shall either be made by the single paper created by this system or , in case such a paper is not created , through the input of the data into the data processing system ; &quot;
- to apply the facil@@ itation adopted by the Joint Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 .
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the disp@@ osi@@ tions required in the export , shipping and import of goods shall be laid down in App@@ endi@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre@@ print listed in App@@ endi@@ x I , shall be found in App@@ endi@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
( 1 ) The registration is to be entered into one of the official languages of the contracting parties authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the responsibilities for export or shipping are gro@@ unded .
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the destination country or the transit country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country from the applicant or its representative in this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In the case of paragraph 1 , registration is always to be entered into one of the official languages of the import country if it is carried out in this country using other copies of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use for each individual process of goods of goods between the parties which , if necessary , use the necessary cre@@ denti@@ als in this section , which may , if necessary , be included in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be associated with a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions of collective deliveries , the relevant authorities may be able to fores@@ ee that the disp@@ at@@ ches for export and shipping procedures are based on one and the same pre @-@ printing by means of the copies intended for these products . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities will be satisfied , as far as possible , that the details contained in the individual phases of the application are included in the registration . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The customs authorities of these countries may request each other to ensure a smooth exchange of goods between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , insofar as they regard it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance can be denied or denied completely or partially , if the Land of Justice is deemed to interfere with its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests , or may viol@@ ate an operating , commercial or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the event of refusal or refusal of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its grounds must be communicated irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably to the seeking country . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is requ@@ esting administrative assistance , which she cannot afford herself if she is seeking it , she points to this circum@@ stance in her request . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information received after paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and enjoy the protection granted to the country &apos;s national law which it has received for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which she has given , and may otherwise be used otherwise by the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
( 1 ) There is a Joint Committee in which each contracting party is represented by this convention .
&quot; ( 4 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall be governed by a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which , among other things , regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of meetings , as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term of office . &quot;
( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may deploy sub@@ committees and working groups that support him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee has the task of managing this Convention and ensuring its proper use .
&quot; to this end , the Committee shall regularly inform the contracting parties about practical experiences with the application of the Convention ; he speaks out recommendations and , in the cases , sum@@ mar@@ ises 3 resolutions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee decides to make changes to the app@@ endi@@ ces to the Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 ( 3 ) of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Mi@@ xed Committee accepted a resolution under the reservation of the provision of the constitutional requirements , the decision shall come into force on the first day of the second month following notification of the ann@@ ul@@ ment of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party meets appropriate measures to ensure effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of this Convention , with the need to take into account the difficulties inherent in the goods traffic as far as possible and to provide satisfactory solutions to the difficulties arising from the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , as well as for the areas of EF@@ TA countries on the one hand . &quot;
( 2 ) This Convention applies also to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the princip@@ ality is associated with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union contract .
&quot; any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement under observ@@ ance of a 12 @-@ month period ; the written notice shall be addressed to the Dep@@ os@@ it@@ ar mentioned in Article 17 , which noti@@ fies them to all other parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , insofar as the Parties until November 1 , 1987 have deposited their acceptance certificates to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities by November 1 , 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , it enters into force on the first day of the second month after the last acceptance certificate . &quot;
&quot; this Convention is written in a document in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Italian , Portuguese , Swedish and Spanish ; it is deposited in the Archive of the Council of the European Communities ; this con@@ veys a certified copy of each contracting party . &quot;
I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for co @-@ operation between the European Economic Community and the International Maritime Research Council .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will come back as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . in view of the responsibility of the Commission regarding the management of fish stocks , the Council cons@@ ents to submit all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the current situation as well as the reports of its Advisory Board of Fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly advise on how to intensi@@ fy the cooperation between both parties , and in particular to investigate the possibilities which allow the Commission to establish a closer link to the Council &apos;s Advisory Board of Fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 4 . in the signing of this agreement , the Community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 D@@ KR and then make annual payments . &quot;
&quot; the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings , which are conven@@ ed on special request by the Commission . &quot;
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties are reviewed again . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement will be extended on the basis of existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
&quot; every party has the possibility to withdraw from the agreement at any time , subject to a one year notice period . &quot;
&quot; in view of clause 3 , the Council agrees with a scientifically qualified representative of the Commission to recognize observer status at meetings of the Council &apos;s Advisory Committee on Fish@@ eries Management . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask the word and to participate in the meetings , but would not have the possibility of changing the agen@@ das of the meetings . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to tell me if these agreements are acceptable as the basis for a co @-@ operation between your council and the community .
I assume that this letter and your answer will be the agreement on cooperation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community .

the Parties to the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the Custom@@ s Area .
&quot; it is desirable that the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System , which was closed on 14 June 1983 in Brussels , entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in general , that without a change in Article 13 of the aforementioned Convention , the Convention would remain in@@ secure at the time of the entry into force . &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the international agreement concluded on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the harmon@@ ised system for the designation and codi@@ fication of goods , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; paragraph 1 receives the following form : &quot;

&quot; however , only states , customs or economic uni@@ ons can document the certificate of acceptance of this protocol , which previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication , or at the same time under@@ line its certificate of rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention or at the same time post@@ p@@ one . &quot;
&quot; B . any state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention pursuant to paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the version modified by the protocol . &quot;
&quot; - a plant that is indispensable not only for the entertainment and conservation of soils , but which also allows the exploitation of land that does not allow any other planting , and even with extensive cultivation that constitutes the main part of today &apos;s production , favour@@ ably responds to any improvement of the cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that from its cultivation depends on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which themselves are completely dependent on the measures required to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and table oli@@ ven represent essential ingredients in the areas where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer income ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that this causes all kinds of difficulties , which seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers , and end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in the countries where the olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
