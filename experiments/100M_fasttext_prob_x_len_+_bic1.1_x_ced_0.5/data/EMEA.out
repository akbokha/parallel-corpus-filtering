&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or its treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied or the processed tablets can be used in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , such as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably primarily known as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree , acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the brain activity causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms to be reduced and their recur@@ rence is prevented . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the onset of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased tur@@ mo@@ il over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , over twelve weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients addressing the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the processed tablets and the solution .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
&quot; moreover , up to 74 weeks abili@@ fy abili@@ fy the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes of previously treated patients and if it was given an additional treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of abili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled feeding ) , ac@@ ath@@ ema ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorders , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , were out@@ weighed against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in quick control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of abili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and addressing their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurred during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk estim@@ ations for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ ge and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dose of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; this drug may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total reduction in incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Parkinson &apos;s , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ lan@@ ici@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy may include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose is of benefit since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; when administered by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ test . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in one hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients receiving an approach to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales , defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ as@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher recur@@ rence rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a significant reduction of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage of over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a holding effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum responses , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase for over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ isation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination of drugs is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ related effects were observed . &quot;
a non @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics yiel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety resin , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the edge @-@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; also , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11@@ fold of the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can use the enam@@ el tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases at the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy also when treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , per@@ spir@@ ation and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk estim@@ ations for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a significant reduction of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 . in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11@@ fold of the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used to quickly control a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution and commen@@ ce with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status under consideration of the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine by Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melted tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations into the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution in patients with ap@@ athy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , per@@ spir@@ ation and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ ge and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was larger compared to the all@@ otted dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) were used as a single dose in@@ tra mus@@ cul@@ arly and which simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dose of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was larger compared to the all@@ otted dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects appeared more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy may include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution , with statisti@@ cally significant improvements related to a@@ stringent / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ap@@ athy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; mean improvement from bas@@ eline value to the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased patient number . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients receiving an approach to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales that were defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher recur@@ rence rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &quot; weight gain &quot; was significantly less patients with a gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum responses , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to placebo in terms of the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % bigger than the AU@@ C after receiving the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to both form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular . &quot;
in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety resin treatment , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the edge @-@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; also , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in view of the efficacy indicators such as time to the worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival , there was no difference between the drugs . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other metastatic breast cancer treatments showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who have low levels of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood before starting treatment . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was no longer more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval to the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited Company Limited for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease , and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ at@@ ry &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted in patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ based nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the plat@@ el@@ et number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a bi@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients receive nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to witness no child during and up to six months after treatment . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a block@@ age , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported to 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 listed the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in blood , reduced potassium in blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ ge , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in mouth , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , body pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency were possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events . &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ cot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules out of the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ activity and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in induc@@ es the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ se@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated through the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ary receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ated protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ret@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation appears in the tumor area .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two random@@ ised , un@@ connected trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study . &quot;
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in the form of two @-@ hour pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metasta@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity towards pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substance ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to an extensive extra @-@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) compared to a solution @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro @-@ some and tissue layers is reported to be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which points to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be respected when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

&quot; after the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should be filled immediately into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorisation for the placing on the market is provided with the following information and materials prior to the launch of the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy :
&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging supplement . • With a clear illustration of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood cl@@ ots in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected . &quot;
treatment with se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be checked prior to the treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ic deficiency or by addressing the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; after injection , Ab@@ se@@ amed was treated as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study where the effects of inj@@ ected ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as in those patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , stab@@ bing mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the placing of se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical interventions ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose that is required for control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permissible dose required for the control of an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by a minimum of 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained between 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reproductive cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained between 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproductive cy@@ te number by &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , and the response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , where precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should be given a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula pin , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medication into the circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or underlying path@@ ologies in patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the plat@@ el@@ et and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te figures are normal , and if no other cause of a loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous utilisation of Ab@@ sen@@ amed in patients with a risk of an an@@ emia @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events was observed , when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ dently coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk balancing taking into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients with greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may pers@@ ist for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosis must be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ale i@@ fo@@ ams , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , vascular thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ase vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetic engineering epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ ende@@ mic patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas , and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ oma , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 22 prostate cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; in 1895 , patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors , 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis . &quot;
survival and progression showed a total of 28@@ 33 patients in five controlled trials ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed a more un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and in case of controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded .
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa conditions after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels , which are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not elevated to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 in animal experimental studies with approximately the 20 times the recommended weekly dose of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced p@@ liable body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of in@@ secure significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a period of no more than 3 days outside the cooling box and not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by an aff@@ i@@ xed tab , so if necessary , the dimensions of partial quantities are possible . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot;

&quot; prior to the launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorisation must provide the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • A summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging supplement . &quot;
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and implemented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is set up and operational before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in traffic .
&quot; the owner of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , listed in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan and additional measures relating to pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance , was agreed upon as in version 5 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and as per each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan outlined by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; &quot; CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use &quot; &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the toxic@@ ity of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information that may affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) • following demand by E@@ MEA &quot;
• Dur@@ ing a month prior to your treatment have suffered a heart attack or a stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) - the danger of a drop of blood in veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - for example if you have previously performed such a blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is re@@ formed during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform regular blood checks if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , the dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before starting treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ yss@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given intraven@@ ously by injection in a vein if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of dying could be increased . &quot;
&quot; in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs through inadequate cardiac output , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ sen@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 your doctor will regularly determine your levels of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ sen@@ amed dose accordingly , in order to keep the risk of coron@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be very carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and may adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery is in store for you , before the start of the treatment , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to investigate the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia and be treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / using other medicines , or have recently been taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ yss@@ amed , your doctor will possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means for building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out Ab@@ se@@ amed even under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) , both in women after menop@@ ause and in men . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms experienced in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years has been studied . &quot;
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of fluid frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other component .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how the medicine is to be applied , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to approve A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s placing on the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • requ@@ is@@ ite appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing assistance is available &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , A@@ cla@@ sta , are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data is missing for safety and efficacy . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population . &quot;
&quot; before starting treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of pre@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the treatment was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium @-@ values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently depl@@ eted hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial were reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was observed , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
&quot; in 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients , oste@@ o@@ arthritis occurred in the jaw area at one patient treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density of ≤ 1.5 and at least two light or medium @-@ heavy current spinal frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ 1.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric @-@ cell frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed the same lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of the bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the th@@ igh area by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken out of the basin . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ A ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume compared to placebo and the maintenance of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone structure .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C telep@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the duration of the study . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below bas@@ eline for up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased BM@@ D at all points of time . &quot;
&quot; over 24 months , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to a 5.@@ 4 % increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total hardness and 4.3 % on the placebo . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and 185 patients evaluated the BM@@ D after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % compared to placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior compared to the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at based on the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
&quot; 11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid , compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months , was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies . &quot;
&quot; for the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influ@@ encing was observed after 6 months compared to bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( response to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % to 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi @-@ phase disappearance from the large circulation system with half @-@ life t t ½ a 0.@@ 24 and t ½ a 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early part phases ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values mentioned above ) probably represent rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total @-@ body clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration over time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metabol@@ ised in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , drug @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance until 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; since severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is restricted to data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ single @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in mice .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C ) were prescribed for 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure referred to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application for accumulated ex@@ positions , which adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ retro@@ active effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmaceutical cooperative system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) approved in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all of the following R@@ MP versions approved by CH@@ MP are required to carry out the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) approved in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • within 60 days when an important milestone ( to pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease patho@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens being made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Pa@@ get mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by restoring bone reconstruction again , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forces the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to be harmful to the kidneys .
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drinks , you are concerned that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood during the in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if missed by A@@ cla@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms at yourself after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle sp@@ as@@ ms or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , ti@@ redness , ting@@ ling sensation , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , trem@@ bling , temporary un@@ consciousness , pain disorder , diar@@ rhe@@ a , pain in the eyes , chest pain , hypertension , redness , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , transi@@ ent up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of serum cre@@ atine , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , were reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects which are not listed in this utility information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta 2 or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or its treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is also used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to estimate in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were noted during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of upper respiratory tissue . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is required while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight inc@@ isions
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) and around the ar@@ z
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also contain one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - in addition to obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other closest persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not adequately demonstrated .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to bas@@ eline , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg were 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 Wei@@ ght reduction and further risk factors In the trials in patients with no diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who achieved a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the average weight change between the 20 mg and placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim

&quot; influence of food : he subjects , who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the wet condition or after a high @-@ fat meal , showed an increase of 67 % in the case of the intake of food by 67 % respectively , respectively by 48 % . &quot;
patients with black skin color can reduce up to 31 % less C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .

&quot; 5.3 Pre @-@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse events , which were not observed in clinical studies , but which appeared in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress appears to be connected with the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a prolonged period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycl@@ one disorders . &quot;
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &apos;s influence on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , it can be applied to patients with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ f@@ onic acid or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic acid or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ f@@ onic acid or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood glucose levels were lowered when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin was 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values while the additional dose of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that , as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with higher output h@@ ep@@ atic cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ stomach problems , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued should be led to the clinical evaluation by the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with a fluid retention in some cases . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or three @-@ way combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but on @-@ board doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on impaired vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological investigation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ator .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the parent animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; single cases : unknown ( not estimated from available data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the shape of the tower and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as it can also be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T sti@@ ckers spread across three times the upper limit of the normal range , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one res@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch it was rarely reported about heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients were conducted in the groups treated with comparison medications . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model . &quot;
it has been shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to post the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimi@@ zing insulin were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study on type 2 diabe@@ tics in a small 18 weeks study .
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as in@@ significant , yet clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ nat@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ized in groups which received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the top concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it has been proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral treatment of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subject ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma elimination time of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and apes coinci@@ ded after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the formation and increased insulin resistance to the parent animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to an increased frequency of col@@ onic tumours .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ ator .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed consistently a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ nat@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , both of an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mortality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving syn@@ dic@@ ation , an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women demonstrated . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ nat@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

some patients with long @-@ term type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and heart disease or previous stroke treated with Ac@@ tos and insulin developed heart failure .
&quot; in clinical trials in which pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was compared with other oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics or placebo ( active @-@ free tablets ) , there was a higher number of frac@@ tures in women ( but not in men ) that earned pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;

&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane &apos;s placing on the European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to Insul@@ in animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to acet@@ one in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
&quot; prior to travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy , and his patients always ask for other medications taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 How@@ ever hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , that can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics may cause loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain functioning and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
&quot; 5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood glucose adjustment , however , may be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum of the working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total lifetime is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed resor@@ ption .
a range of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety resin , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended - after removing the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane pass bottle from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) , before it is sum@@ med up according to the instructions for use for the first use . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .

&quot; 12 . both hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabe@@ tic therapy increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o . &quot;
&quot; 13 The intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood glucose adjustment , however , may be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life ( t ½ ) is therefore more a measure of resor@@ ption than a measure of the elimination per se of the insulin produced from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of just a few minutes in blood circulation ) .

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atic notes ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking further medicines to prevent rheum@@ atism . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a urine acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ Pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients in placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver function . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits ( including a known or currently existing g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the res@@ inous acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other res@@ inous drugs , acute rheum@@ atic attack may occur during the treatment beginning , because the lowering of serum resin acidity can first mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function before beginning the ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and , in the course of the course , a liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not perform exchange rate studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O escap@@ ement can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ spi@@ egels ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous gift of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ ining ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ e@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the concur@@ rent other substance required .
&quot; in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous use of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease of C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not be close to side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born baby .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operation of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator reported in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ us in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0,3 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during the long term renewal studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data . &quot;
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 , or at lower frequency : &quot;
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ esth@@ esia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin lesi@@ ons , skin lesi@@ ons , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , decrease of TS@@ H concentration in blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease of white blood cells . &quot;
the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism in humans and is produced as part of the reaction cr@@ un@@ ting hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; in every study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly Ser@@ um res@@ ins were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; Plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine index at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of serum resin levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 times daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function . the AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 times daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of ser@@ ums acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ pent@@ ine @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ pent@@ ine @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism in the months 16 @-@ 24 .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out node , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the frac@@ tures up to month 24 . &quot;
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally by dose of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses . &quot;
&quot; for dos@@ ages ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 times a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to around 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ ums was observed , as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro @-@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine found itself as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ c@@ ital@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the mean AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times from 7,5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
&quot; 12 liver function limitation After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition @-@ cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly d@@ osed group , at about 11 times the exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ alli@@ zation and urine composition and considered un@@ relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were around 4,@@ 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by lowering the performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , about 4,@@ 3 times and in tra@@ iling rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , showed no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as sour r@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in cases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. to approve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following recommendations are to be followed closely in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie ahead of the first dietary intake of the day which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under the seizure of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms which indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out to remedy symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms , which point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , the stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ es were rarely reported ( after market launch ) , among them some severe and with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men administered mainly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available to indicate whether the depos@@ iting of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet the next morning after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the dose of one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports date from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was also reported . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ um decreased to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ succession of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine D@@ 3 is the increase in the intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia may result in a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

&quot; patients received AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the lower strength ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( n = 350 ) or Fos@@ am@@ ax ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ) 70 mg once a week ( n = 3@@ 32 ) ; additional vitamin D supplements were forbidden . &quot;
&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ hepatitis D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in the phase III trials , the medium An@@ sti@@ ege of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.3 % compared to placebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved with the percentage of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to uph@@ old ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15,@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption R@@ ank@@ ed to an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast . &quot;
bio@@ availability fell accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distri@@ butions of rats showed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly dis@@ semin@@ ated into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After an intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after an intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10@@ mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion With the administration of radioactive marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the share of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is still to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ ph was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with Adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the concur@@ rent medication needs to be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ der@@ ings of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained . &quot;
the dosage of adv@@ ant should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood reflection requirements ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after adjustment . &quot;
&quot; in Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ ph can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of drugs , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be in@@ stituted intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for making an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ al transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral intraven@@ ous therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustment can be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral intraven@@ ous therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - Rec@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a gra@@ ft recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules be converted to a once daily dose of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , must be carried out . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to lawyer once a day the treatment must begin with the oral initial dose recommended in the kidney and liver transplan@@ t for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; in adult patients who are converted to adv@@ ant , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ant in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal cancer patients , pro@@ gra@@ f was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , at pancre@@ atic patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function , since kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus based therapy be advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in a single case by using thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king Co@@ ordination .
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks of transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ lies of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ant , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time applying substances which could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose may require several days before the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of tal@@ low in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , in the first period following liver transplantation , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s tal@@ lies usually lie in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with transplan@@ ted and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ der@@ ings of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy specialist in comparison with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation advanced . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation advanced . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided or other plant cur@@ es during treatment with adv@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur also under the law . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ated , lac@@ tose , patients with the rare heredi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption are particularly careful . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels at the same time the dose of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose accordingly ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormonal exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As well as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; mechanism of action and pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic action At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection within the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific range of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) , 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ ph and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ ate mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for lawyers and 97@@ ,5 % for pro@@ gra@@ f ; 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) died . &quot;

&quot; incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , loss of gra@@ ft , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up ) was 15.@@ 1 % in the pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; 175 patient transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atitis and in 6@@ 30 cases after colon@@ nat@@ al transplan@@ t were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used to treat liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients surrounded by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45@@ ,@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in one study the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who were simultaneously undergoing a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation which received tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) after a random@@ ized trial .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ectal transplantation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of 10 to 15 ng / ml and recently transplantation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the invol@@ un@@ tary fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism associated with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile . &quot;
&quot; the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f , in cases of stable patients treated with pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks of transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be an alternative therap@@ ist to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation advanced . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevent ble@@ ed@@ ings in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ ots ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ a is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced which enables it to form the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II .
&quot; adv@@ a is similar to a drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years of age , the application of the drug was investigated for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ance in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic episodes was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ a may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the appropriate period should not sink below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
repeat all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment process , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dose should be administered after the patient has been discovered , and the maximum inj@@ ections rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always tested against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk in the first 20 expos@@ ures is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known inhibit@@ ors development , the re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product was observed on another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ current ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there is no experience of the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients showing a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed difficult to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years of age and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was detected by a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
&quot; in previously untreated patients from a current clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persi@@ sting peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a c@@ of@@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were carried out in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP grants 120 a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ wom@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not notice whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ Ex@@ in .
&quot; changing the release of active ingredients means that the tablets are so composite , that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and young people aged 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will end as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cli@@ pped . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients below Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who were alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ advant@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from con@@ genital glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral isch@@ emia ) or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze on the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , cr@@ ushing or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term application may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can continue as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity associated with combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine associated with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ acet@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ oline , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to make appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not examined in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment with hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be dismissed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing the der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka might otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the context of clinical trials in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or@@ ical test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for metabolism of the enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; as reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impairment of traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult micro @-@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ dial pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision , hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective impact or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with the treatment period of the 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , it is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers for more than 14 days , the flow@@ rate weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metabolism @-@ changing . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on conventional safety resin studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any special dangers to the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , pharmaceutical cooperative system described and functioning before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drinking or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in medical history ( difficulty of breathing due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache , or a strengthening of existing headaches . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
transport and operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects , which are not indicated in this utility information . &quot;
&quot; heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash have been reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of padd@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe permission to transport A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or no meal , for reli@@ eving symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current course of disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have ceased and can be resum@@ ed . &quot;
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impairment of road safety or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , which was administered over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot;
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the eti@@ ology in the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easily pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all of the ur@@ tic@@ ist diseases , it is expected that , in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vi@@ gil@@ ance as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that drug interactions cannot be completely ruled out with other medicines . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with dessert adi@@ n in a dosage of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of dessert adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety resin , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any specific dangers to the human being . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ aller@@ genic , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ ph@@ leg@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support treatment of infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance levels ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully metabol@@ ised , is identical to that in children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered . &quot;
&quot; children between 1 and 11 years old , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily total dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of di@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data for adults in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study for adults and adolescents , in which des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment , nor to an increase in sleep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited @-@ metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup@@ formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metabol@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the strain ( AU@@ C ) was about 6 times higher and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
&quot; there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active agent accumulation after once daily use of chlorine adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) , over 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot;
12 In various single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III Bra@@ ung@@ lasses with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for intake with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to take one once a day in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were applied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate was well tolerated in two single dose trials ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where , in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective impact or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x by A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , while food T@@ max of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n extends from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H @-@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours . &quot;

there are limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el can be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Si@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 m@@ g. of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to the dosage formulation of dessert adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the rein@@ forcing of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ valence of this poorly @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to the dosage formulation of dessert adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective impact or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of the prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ations tests for the processed tablet revealed that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irritation in clinical application .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years of age which is fully metabol@@ ised is identical to that in children who metabol@@ ise normally .
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; for small children aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo reported diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was observed for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may , depending on the duration of symptoms , may alternatively also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited @-@ metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution to caffeine intake contains the same concentration of dessert adi@@ n , no equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
in various single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for approval of the A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov market for the prevention of avi@@ an H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from man to man because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognis@@ es as body @-@ alien ) , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medication the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice a day 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; in children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase is determined according to the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; however , the damage to the immune system and the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases can also be delayed . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in 20@@ 6 adults , previously taken with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ prov@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase reinforced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r came to a greater decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded just like as@@ per@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the enhancing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and may also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver failure with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under one age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ogen@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ts factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are present . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immunity may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in an attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ desirable effects were observed on the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded when pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice a day in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amp@@ agn@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in conjunction with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine &apos;s imagin@@ ative component it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this drug should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ a@@ vir@@ on could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the Plas@@ ma@@ concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thereby an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ cri@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with azi@@ ase , may result in interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs , if they are used in combination with as@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ al@@ ase as it may cause resor@@ ption defects . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase may considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism depends heavily on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are marked increases in the plasma levels at the same time ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while the dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be increased ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral bi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time the use of ast@@ er@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adapt the pren@@ a@@ virus dose when pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of adding Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ ably , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of potential benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation @-@ related rats , am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the destruction in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
&quot; further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the treatment of HIV , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and deep sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated individuals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( spi@@ kes ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ arly nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gene and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ ar stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ viral activity in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I / M / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / V , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations occurred : &quot;
&quot; on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / M / M / M / M / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to assess the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
firms that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r @-@ associated genetic patterns creates a certain resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data to cross resistance between am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with a f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus ( one of which showed a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and zo@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early canc@@ elling of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) or a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study . &quot;
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ sub@@ mis@@ sive threshold of 0.4 lo@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached as@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of ampl@@ itu@@ des is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ minist@@ ering am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous eating intake affected the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the aggregate concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bi@@ ased ampl@@ itu@@ des , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bi@@ ased ampl@@ itu@@ des remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given concur@@ r@@ ently with as@@ gen@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; from the solution , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ as lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence for the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on human subjects , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation testing ( Am@@ es test ) , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of as@@ gen@@ ase nor after treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate , both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which indicate delayed development , were observed in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to human therapy . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the enhancing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be performed in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug addic@@ ts , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amp@@ agn@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ cri@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of the Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 although there are no clinical data available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , field odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to an increase in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of potential benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the destruction in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ viral activity in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bi@@ ased ampl@@ itu@@ des remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given concur@@ r@@ ently with as@@ gen@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in dos@@ ages , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to man after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation testing ( Am@@ es test ) , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate , both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in juven@@ iles the met@@ abo@@ li@@ met@@ alli@@ zation paths are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take @-@ in is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the benefit of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking @-@ in was neither demonstrated in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to stop taking ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for in@@ taking and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution is contra@@ indicated in children under 4 years of age , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are present . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; taking A@@ gener@@ ase concur@@ r@@ ently can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to adverse events associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is unknown . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us may not be applied to the propylene gly@@ co@@ l contained during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation @-@ related rats , am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a re@@ production study of pregnant rats , which was given by the destruction in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the treatment of HIV , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ res@@ c@@ itation volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

&quot; important information about certain other components of A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for Inclu@@ ding The solution to take @-@ in contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l , which can lead to side effects in high doses . &quot;
&quot; propylene gly@@ co@@ l may cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken , special care should be taken when taking A@@ gener@@ ase is required precau@@ tions ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ gener@@ ase If you miss taking A@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking it as before . &quot;
&quot; headache , fatigue , diar@@ rho@@ ea , illness , vom@@ iting , flat@@ ul@@ ence skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally , the rash may be serious and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot;
&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms , and face , fat removal on the abdom@@ en , and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat sw@@ ell@@ ings in the neck ( &quot; &quot; j@@ acks &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ solar ( TP@@ GS ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial gum scent , cit@@ om@@ en@@ tho@@ l , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric cit@@ rate D@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ layer to apply to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo either daily or five times a week . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four major studies was 15 % to 52 % compared to the placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % compared to placebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can continue until all visible cow@@ ards have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only in@@ completely healed should another therapy be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
it should be considered in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , where no daily speech therapy was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with circumc@@ ision have been observed . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions oc@@ cured at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections applied to the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral area , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od inside 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed approximately 12 weeks after the treatment is completed . &quot;
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the use of pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that there is less lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands do not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions often occur but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients who receive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been quanti@@ fiable , no recommendation can be recommended during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most frequently shared and likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the trials of three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the place of treating the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects listed below .
&quot; the most frequent side effect , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effect , were in these studies a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of the clinical signs , according to the test plan , shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently occurred to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 30 % ) , erosion ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs , according to the test plan , shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme has often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe de@@ formation and destruction ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; accidental oral absorption of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , may lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigations . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts during I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the total 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super @-@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data available from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic activity lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external clin@@ ically , ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis and cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively . &quot;
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 Pati@@ ents with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drug in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 one @-@ time bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the estimated half @-@ life time was around 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study , which points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin . &quot;
systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis or super @-@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat , doses of 0.5 mg / 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application did not reveal any similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in der@@ mal administration of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk to humans due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) that have formed on the skin in the field of gen@@ itals ( sex organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● High @-@ surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common and slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
&quot; if left untreated , it can cause problems , especially in the face , so early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to much of the solar radiation during their previous life . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied for flat ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor before starting treatment . &quot;
&quot; if adverse reactions occur in the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream does not appear with an association or patch . o If reactions occur in the treated place , which will give you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are blocked , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , there may be swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties when the fores@@ kin is re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other medicines to have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts during the genital area sexual intercourse is the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) to perform .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently been used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
do not breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over the breast milk occurs .
&quot; the frequency and duration of treatment are different with clin@@ ically , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the cow@@ ards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin have to pull back the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream for 6 weeks per week , to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist about it immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin responds too strongly to treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected area of skin with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections ; it can cause a blue stain sooner or later , or it can cause depression . &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
&quot; in addition , you can experience it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas that you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , there are more light skin reactions , which end up again within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sc@@ ur@@ ation , irrit@@ ability , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , irritation , swelling , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , throat , fever , fever , weakness , or ch@@ ills ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic treatment in patients with scre@@ ened diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
&quot; administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly investigated by the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion point . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with si@@ ghted diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been established , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; due to the theoretically hei@@ gh@@ tened risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , a little experience has to be cau@@ tious . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ thon ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not directly or indirectly affect pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there is no data available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients enrolled in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or over , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment . patients aged less than 5 years had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients did not present det@@ ectable antibodies by radio@@ activity ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients , in whom there was never a servo conversion . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies was not related to the incidence of un@@ desirable drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme @-@ replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken from cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that had the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for efficacy was the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and sal@@ vi@@ ability , shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size up to the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe circulation and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a gain increase ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form were limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety resin , toxic@@ ity associated with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any special dangers to the human being . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except the ones listed under 6.@@ 6. &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the placing on the market has completed the following programme of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy data on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ im@@ pregn@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
advice on handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is provided for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hypertension • lower oxygen in the blood • Response to the in@@ fusion point &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; for patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed or decreased or the dose can be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer life @-@ time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pass bottle has to be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % of the sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the penetration tank and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma except the majority of plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the end of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift as well as on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the duration of the therapy and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after every third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose review must take place taking account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or no @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity . 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 , or above , in comparison with patients aged 65 years , an increased side effect risk exists . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary for patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min which exceed the dose adjustment recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ ic values of &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with respect to the bone mar@@ row therapy and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ony has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ at@@ ry , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity seen in previous treatment courses ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ inflammatory toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were treated as a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy should be considered in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space . &quot;
&quot; 5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic compound . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible fo@@ aming of the reproductive capacity exists by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised of the course of treatment to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; ( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , except if it is absolutely necessary and after careful balancing of benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity exists by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice on the blocking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of un@@ desirable effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma , which random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed - and 163 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma , which random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the summari@@ zed results of three individual P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Mon@@ other@@ api@@ ary studies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ al values of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of un@@ desirable effects that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , which random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC that random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine . &quot;

&quot; from clinical trials , occasional cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy with respiratory failure . &quot;
it has been reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .

&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma demonstrated that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically meaningful survival compared to those patients who have only been treated with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ plac@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of the lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy confirmed a medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = moderate @-@ to @-@ treat ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ sub@@ sistence limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ inum @-@ cy@@ t@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients also needed the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparation ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mon@@ otherapy were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found again in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , they were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the semi epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; if not applicable , retention times and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; dissolve the contents of 100 mg @-@ flow bottles with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of sodium @-@ chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the product quality . &quot;
each pass bottle has to be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % of the sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
&quot; 23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic compound . &quot;

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of products . &quot;
&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; when these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats that are fed to the food un@@ st@@ owed to the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received all@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stools , stools , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stools , discharge o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( fa@@ ec@@ es ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft stools . &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be applied to patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women and nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a licence for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , the dosage is not necessary for elderly patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Dur@@ able treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Dur@@ able treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic monitoring , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant contrac@@ ep@@ tives to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
&quot; in the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normally @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who at the same time received or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
the frequency of the reported side effects found following the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to conver@@ sions with regard to potential and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , rapid re@@ formation of possible systemic effects stem@@ ming from or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ mp@@ ing properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in rem@@ nant of the ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ a .
&quot; from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , o@@ ily @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight loss was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot;
&quot; the average change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in therapeutic doses not metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was given the minimal systemic resor@@ bed dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety resin , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any special risk to the human being . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation application must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , will be applied before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects , which are not indicated in this utility information . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of the treatment , as at this time you may not have reduced the fat percentage in your diet altogether . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ fat diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit is likely to exceed your recommended amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a rich dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; please refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the effect of the capsule , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can &apos;t handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related symptoms . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can only climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities daily . • &quot; &quot; Middle Physi@@ cal Ac@@ tivity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minutes garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the European Union for placing Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
al@@ op@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately enam@@ el chemotherapy based on cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a highly em@@ ph@@ ased chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ni@@ otic ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required , while at the same time the administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; apart from other chemotherapy drugs , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days following chemotherapy either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics based on tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , p@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , ox@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences concerning the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ation are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with al@@ op@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to date ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were shown as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects to observe . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy in an al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ ph@@ ased chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life of 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ ph@@ ased chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly enam@@ el chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval are comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; purpose of the study carried out by 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration , a gradual elimination of plasma concentrations follows a gradual elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to lesser extent , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable agent made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; following a unique intraven@@ ous bolt injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance was 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ inations and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dosage is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ lon@@ gs the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for the unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this authorisation for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the drug approved in the context of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of the authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of the Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a bi@@ ologically active ingredient named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages the damage ; furthermore , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon made data suggest@@ ing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided by the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed in the fact that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C addressing the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease progres@@ sed again in more patients than with the reference doctor ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated in the study to determine to what extent the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a rash associated with skin infection ) and small infected lesi@@ ons ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which were det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ eto@@ genic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not affect this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated must not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
&quot; in all five studies , the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection had fallen after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin @-@ findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home @-@ dogs , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the place of the order .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections vis @-@ à @-@ vis the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • Anti @-@ Virus Inf@@ ant La@@ dies , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a licence for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection can begin . &quot;
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of secondary untreated open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical use on sk@@ ul@@ led skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily , 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ ul@@ led skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement of effects on birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical studies , 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , was the most commonly reported adverse drug Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the date of administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a deriv@@ ative deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of Ret@@ re@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding Centre and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ re@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appear question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ re@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sample took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake at humans after topical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabol@@ ism In vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro @-@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , less involved in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching a maximum exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ unk@@ ed skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;

&quot; irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show , you should quit the application of al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with al@@ tar@@ go unless specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is out of sight on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a sterile band@@ age or a ga@@ z@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ ani is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and is assured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix adults approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 months gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ ani &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients that respond to any of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ lution with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refresh is desired for both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) , following a basic di@@ lution with the combination vaccine , are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet fully assured that immuno@@ competent persons , who have referred to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her than protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ections , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic response should always be available immediately after the treatment of the vaccine according to the treatment of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 @-@ ELISA units inform@@ ally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals suffering from disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody is under conditions , so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally , as in these cases it may result in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ ani was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tus@@ sis , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ om@@ ers and preserv@@ atives @-@ containing vaccine formulation was observed in a clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines aged 1 to and including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants from 12 to 15 years old , the compatibility of Ambi@@ ani compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine was compared . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and vulner@@ ability based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis for each person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects following the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given ambi@@ rix had reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of those who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and vulner@@ ability was low and comparable to the observed after combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ tion group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose drop @-@ down vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination schem@@ as with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination schem@@ as with the combination vaccine containing 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units inform@@ ally infected hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to including 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ ence and 147 received the standard combine vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination was administered . &quot;
the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 @-@ ELISA units inform@@ ally activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for individuals who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units inform@@ ally in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ atic A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ ani was administered at the same time as the first dose of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tus@@ sis , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study , which was carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar levels of ser@@ opo@@ ei@@ sm and serum conversion rates as for the previous formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ cu@@ tion to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; pursuant to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ani cannot completely protect itself from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus before ad@@ minist@@ ering the two vacc@@ inations , an vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction may manifest through it@@ chy skin rash , difficulty breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a hepatitis B protection ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; if there is a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against termination of the vaccine series .
&quot; sometimes , ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently , or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or has been planned or planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ ani Please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; ♦ A very common ( more than 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the inc@@ ision point or redness • Mat@@ ability • irrit@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite , loss of appetite &quot;
♦ A frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
&quot; further side effects reported in days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 mixed doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or expanded strokes , which can be it@@ ching or infl@@ atable , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has become known since issu@@ ance of the initial authorization for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believed that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ani remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ ani has been placed in traffic only in one Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited because of the low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ completely en@@ cephal@@ opathy or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y ( through the stomach @-@ blanket in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo @-@ free drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; may also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a @-@ cycle , Am@@ mon@@ aps effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps have been approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease , limited information is available to this drug at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication is for use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein up@@ take of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ or@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine sub@@ stitution is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should be given ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ es when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , correspon@@ dingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it resulted in slow@@ ing the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic @-@ active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues . &quot;
&quot; it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) by ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium ben@@ zene , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it occurred with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ or@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , was 98 % survival . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber @-@ healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism , and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycl@@ ine disrup@@ tions or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fast no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl @-@ but@@ y@@ rat did not have a complaint with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow pills or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ or@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine sub@@ stitution is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ tur@@ tles were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons occurred in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral dosing of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring sco@@ op of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium chlori@@ de can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the drug may pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headaches , fla@@ vor@@ ing , impaired hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain , and abnormal lab results . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects , which are not indicated in this utility information . &quot;
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box and the container after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date .
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium chlori@@ de can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on identical single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ bri@@ a ( hose , which passes through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is run through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Take a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate out of the container . • Gran@@ t a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top of the knife nozzle to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate out of the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a higher dose , and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with all@@ ure or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI was often used to treat patients a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days and one year overall just as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective in all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as with people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a cardiac infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the placing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union by The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
&quot; for treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , an emergency intervention or early intervention is planned . &quot;
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed subsequently , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical needs , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; an intake of 0.5 mg / kg is supposed to be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI interference is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be done . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bolt dose should be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function limitation ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT will again test 5 minutes after the second starting dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were approved , the ACT was 5 minutes after the administration of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ bol@@ us with an average dose of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or elevated blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ agulation disorders . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial point points occur in PCI patients with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take War@@ far@@ in and are treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again achieved before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te Units ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; the experimental investigations are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ reconc@@ il@@ ine Group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more often adverse events in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measurements for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges performed significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ validation Dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point of the point , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding site , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with a known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ reconc@@ il@@ ine group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more often adverse events in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately terminated and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at the cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; binding of Bi@@ reconc@@ il@@ ine to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part slowly spl@@ its up the binding of Bi@@ reconc@@ il@@ ine @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din helped patients with serum from patients with a par@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was subsequently carried out , an additional bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography in 72 hours were equally distributed across the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin cannot work effectively .
insulin vari@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working times than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ pro . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdom@@ en area . &quot;
&quot; due to reduced glucose concentration and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin must be reduced in patients with reduced liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or canc@@ elling of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the adjustment of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effective profile of the used insulin and can therefore be changed when changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserve can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ acting . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin pulses occur in breast milk , but in general insulin does not interfere with breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed in clinical studies , sorted by system organ@@ groups and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
&quot; cold wel@@ ness , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog changes , headaches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will be missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or by an intraven@@ ous inj@@ ector of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
&quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster , and the active duration is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with Type 1 Diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin regulation in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ous effect , just like the human insulin . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect , approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin . &quot;
&quot; the data showed that at an application of insulin pulses in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ inflammatory gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin treatment was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ denoun@@ cing control than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , as with a human normal insulin , is given before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin vol@@ up@@ is@@ in given 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin vol@@ up@@ is@@ in administered 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
