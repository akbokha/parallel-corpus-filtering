<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied or the processed tablets can be used in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, such as Abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances, which enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably primarily known as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree, acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the brain activity causing psychotic or manic symptoms to be reduced and their recurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the onset of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased turmoil over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, over twelve weeks, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients addressing the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the processed tablets and the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, up to 74 weeks abilify abilify the reoccurrence of manic episodes of previously treated patients and if it was given an additional treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled feeding), acathema (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorders, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with Aripiprazole, were outweighed against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in quick control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and addressing their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, even when treating with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting a year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occurred during the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms treated with Abilify, symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk estimations for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphage and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV proteasinhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dose of abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the adjuvant therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole does not have any negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy may include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdose with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose is of benefit since Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT1- and 5HT7-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"when administered by Aripiprazole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and the puttest."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage of over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a holding effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, in week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features that partially did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum responses, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase for over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to the prevention of bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyisation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of drugs is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolites over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-related effects were observed."</seg>

<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety resin, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the edge-ogenic potential, the preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for the human being."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicological significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal cortex-toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for approval of the Aflunov market for the prevention of avian H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from man to man because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as" "foreign" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"as a result, the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus was removed with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognises as body-alien), cleaned and used as part of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">"as a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines."</seg>

<seg id="1910">"however, the damage to the immune system and the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases can also be delayed."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"in 206 adults, previously taken with proteasinhibitors, the drug Agenerase was compared to other protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-provable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>

<seg id="1915">"in children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children treated with protease inhibitors only very few responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1916">"in the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase reinforced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other proteasinhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1917">"in patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase together with Ritonavir came to a greater decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:"</seg>
<seg id="1918">"the most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue."</seg>

<seg id="2035">"the evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) or a standard of care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"one hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017 study."</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI group with regard to time-adjusted average change from baseline (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non-submissive threshold of 0.4 lo10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbleached asgenase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 had been pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"in the studies, Agenerase was used twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"after 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" unbleached "Agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"after oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amplitudes is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"by contrast, 508% increases by 30% for CMAx when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"administering amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of prenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12)."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"therefore minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous eating intake affected the extent and rate of resorption."</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the aggregate concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbiased amplitudes, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"while the absolute concentration of unbiased amplitudes remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given concurrently with asgenase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"from the solution, amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the approval of the authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of the Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biologically active ingredient named Roferon-A, which is already approved in the EU (also called" reference medicine ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages the damage; furthermore, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast, into which a gene (DNA) is introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon made data suggesting the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"in addition, concerns were expressed in the fact that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C addressing the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease progressed again in more patients than with the reference doctor; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated in the study to determine to what extent the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a rash associated with skin infection) and small infected lesions (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"altargo should not be used to treat infections, which were detectable or presumably caused by methicillinetogenic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not affect this type of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface to be treated must not be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">"in all five studies, the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection had fallen after the end of the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin-findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home-dogs, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (eiterfilled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the place of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections vis-à-vis the risks: • Impetigo, • Anti-Virus Infant Ladies, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a licence for the placing on the market of Altargo across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, treatment should be stopped, the ointment should be carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection can begin."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials of secondary untreated open wounds, the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical use on skulled skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily, 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skulled skin of healthy adult men by 81%."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement of effects on birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical studies, 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, was the most commonly reported adverse drug Irritation at the date of administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a derivative derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retreamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosom which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Binding Centre and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retreamulin at least some infection forms appear questionable, advice should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retreamulin against S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"in a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic intake at humans after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 smeared skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2709">"metabolism In vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver micro-soms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, less involved in CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat microkernel test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">"neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching a maximum exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skunked skin):"</seg>
<seg id="2713">"in an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of foetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined."</seg>
<seg id="2714">"the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacogilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied."</seg>
<seg id="2715">"the owner of the marketing authorisation holder commits to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacogilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambiani is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and is assured that the vaccination plan can be completed from two doses."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defences) as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "alien" "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the vaccination of Twinrix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccination of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adult identical ingredients contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the use of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 months gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambiani's degree of protection was similar to six and a 12-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maternity (fatigue) and irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients that respond to any of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for the basic dilution with Ambirix is made up of two doses, the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresh is desired for both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2741">"the anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), following a basic dilution with the combination vaccine, are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines."</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent persons, who have referred to hepatitis C vaccination, need a refresher than protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injections, an anaphylactic response should always be available immediately after the treatment of the vaccine according to the treatment of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360-ELISA units informally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in case of hemodialysis patients and individuals suffering from disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody is under conditions, so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines can be required."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"as an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal outcome, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"for thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutanally, as in these cases it may result in hemorrhages after intramuscular administration."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"if Ambiani was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1)."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose level (sugar) in the blood or that insulin cannot work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin variisin differs very slightly from the human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working times than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which insulin does not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lispro."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other components or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for placing Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the abdomen area."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to reduced glucose concentration and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin must be reduced in patients with reduced liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A insufficient dosage or cancelling of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The adjustment of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effective profile of the used insulin and can therefore be changed when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, propoxyphene, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, Sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserve can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adrenergic counteracting."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"lipodystrophy Will be missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemics with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a correspondingly trained person or by an intravenous injector of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) and the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster, and the active duration is shorter than with cou- manem normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with Type 1 Diabetes melli- tus, insulin regulation in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesous effect, just like the human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect, approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that at an application of insulin pulses in 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-inflammatory glycaemic control is reached, as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"insulin treatment was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denouncing control than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control, as with a human normal insulin, is given before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
