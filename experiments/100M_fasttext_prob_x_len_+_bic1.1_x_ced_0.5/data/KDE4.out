&quot; to translate the module website , you will find in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . select from the drop @-@ down list the starting and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated into place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , bab@@ y@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated at the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can paste texts directly into translation . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available . &quot;
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Exten@@ sions .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules on your system are if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the module View Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ tion@@ Filter . with the module you can filter through &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default the display starts with the root node of the document , example : &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a more view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree @-@ Maps allows the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily identified when they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the &quot; &quot; Tre@@ em@@ ap &quot; &quot; displays a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or picture of a different file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation , or whether the area of sub @-@ ordin@@ ates should be used ( and hence , there may be a relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle ) . &quot;
&quot; with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View mode , the rule will not always be comp@@ lied with . in case of the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always observed . &quot;
&quot; how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu item View Lo@@ cking to Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent element to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub @-@ entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the module picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the option Tit@@ le of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option Images per line has a slider and a rotation field to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nail in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you determine if the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Fol@@ der , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the File selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set it with a slider or a rotation panel to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
&quot; with the check box original images , you specify whether the original images should be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the commentary box in the comments file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the navigation pane , or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to , into the media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; change the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla , for example , use M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; style templates and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with W3@@ C &apos;s recommendations and other standards .
check the module website to check in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . the following checks can be done :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; check out whether your &amp; HTML ; -@@ document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponds to all found errors are displayed . with this review , you can make sure your pages are displayed by all browsers correctly . &quot;
allows you to review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets involved in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used .
check the links on your page on for@@ warding and faulty link@@ ages . recur@@ sively all links on the website are reviewed .
here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets .
with the module Web Archi@@ ving for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; you can save websites with text and images in .@@ was format .
&quot; with the mouse click on Extras website , and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page . &quot;
&quot; the module Web Archi@@ ving is copyright &amp; copy ; 2001 @-@ 2003 Andreas Schl@@ ap@@ bach , Antonio Lar@@ os@@ sa and Mal@@ te Star@@ os@@ tik schl@@ p@@ b@@ ch @ i@@ am@@ .@@ uni@@ be@@ .@@ ch lar@@ os@@ sa @ k@@ de@@ .org mal@@ te @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; quick image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , they should report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; this means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , please ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
you can also click the digi@@ code ; visit the homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instruction to report in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . just enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains pictures , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view any sub@@ folder as album . no image will be altered . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . this allows you to paste a point in front of the folder name .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ bian list do not have photos as icons . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it may work &amp; digi@@ kam ; possibly also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . &quot;
&quot; photo 2 is a free , further distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that thumb@@ nails can be read out reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to drag thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F. &quot;
&quot; drag and drop pictures everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ m , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . in this way , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame will only work if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos that were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was created first . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select Edit Properties in the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed by a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos after collection . if you want to add or delete collections from the tool@@ bar collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ der , average , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first image will be selected in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ g@@ ste@@ quot ; . this is intended to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; edited ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Key@@ word list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . of course you can use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this in which you can re@@ generate all preview images in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the preview . what information this is , you can edit the settings edited ; set up the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
&quot; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the editing pane , you can see how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view and edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button , and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing by other image processing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image can come . some programs do not store this information when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; del@@ eting , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My data sli@@ des@@ how@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing this , you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and rejected keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or on an existing keyword , and then choose new keyword . if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ stit@@ ch word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then , a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the previ@@ ews of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords you have assigned to it . in this way , you can award a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this will appear below the thumb@@ nail of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you click with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the key menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only displays the keywords that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame indicating the time unit . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the pictures are shown again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . you can search this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criteria . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search is performed . the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit search , the form will appear to input the search again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select to delete the search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you with an expanded search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields by &amp; digi@@ .@@ s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are displayed by operators separately , listed by operators . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they conform to . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . by pushing a picture from anywhere above the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the matching images . also here can be set a threshold value .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zoom out and move it while you click on the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L . add the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the table and its window is opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ kam , main windows , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview tool@@ bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you select preview from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or move operations at one of the pictures , then these are also executed in the other picture . you can thus compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pairs of pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal delete actions work directly from the light table like F@@ 4 File Edit ... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure information . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swi@@ vel the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the Zoom slider under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you match the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , scans or stores digital photos carries a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure , find , protect , and re @-@ use your pictures . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management assumes , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ es and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no stock management to find a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you include anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; please note that you need to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; Export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files do together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend saving the metadata option in the creation page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign key words , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s now take key words , key words , as you frequently call in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically create the tree for you or add the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling one sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphics show how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool for catalo@@ gu@@ ing your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share most of your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming of having associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Google Earth ?
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys by using images with geographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and refers to the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support neither comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for Provider ) : use the provider box to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this , in the image embedded metadata , del@@ eting or changing . this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the near future it will provide such a module for batch processing .
&quot; topics : record errors , disk failure , current sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics for data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these should be handled carefully and you may not be trusted more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliably . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control environments . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for faulty CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to work wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and / Linux ; but it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ othe@@ ques keep track of their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers form a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s fixed faults present the imminent failure . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss because of a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage to your computer . therefore , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the power heat and gro@@ oves the rest . however , remember that not every connector can also contain over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to over@@ voltage protection , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to store your data and run the system in order . some models allow them to work even further until the current runs again . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with electricity problems with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can include this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies the offer includes a backup and a distributed storage . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures , at least , data integrity between operating system and hard disk . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says that if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in desktop systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to reduced damage , such as th@@ ef@@ ste@@ els or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture setting of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit . &quot;
&quot; even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . secure your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; forget airplane disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ aster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into your neighbor &apos;s house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for a loss of data despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync copies only the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
backup important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and metadata , copying the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and have placed the area you want to increase to a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ ER ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of / dev / s@@ db . &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create them yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace the GI@@ F . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved ink assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images but requires very large files .
D@@ NG is a licensed and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the camera image formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and oblig@@ ates to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers now provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to em@@ bed the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits to it because it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the c@@ amer@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures with &amp; digi@@ kam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Add a photo to an album , you will find a description how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page strips properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras all information is not available .
&quot; this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is to click the download button and then download the selection from all . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album , before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected download button is looked up until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed , as normal folder is sorted , displayed . details for folder sorting can be found in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; downloads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete selected deleted items . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were taken successfully in a &amp; edited ; so you should carefully check if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames if you load photos of different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options to rotate and mirror the image and to date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; options Dur@@ ing the transfer , three more options will be made before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concerns the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ o@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you prefer a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % d % d % d % H : % M : % M . to do this , switch the Date &amp; Time option . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you next time open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date where the photo was taken , it is possible to create sub @-@ albums in the target album automatically . all pictures with the same date are downloaded in the same sub@@ album . not all the cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , where the images should be loaded high . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ gra@@ ze an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ geographical mapping module . &quot;
&quot; there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the privileges created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is edited in eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be displayed on a saved preview or start image editing , so set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author title is syn@@ onymous with reference line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the image that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture to others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ der@@ . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be digi@@ pe@@ ated ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this will synchron@@ ize the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different picture formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the illuminated table can be set to the default values . each time you open the light table , these settings are enabled if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are defined here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG uses a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF files , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , because the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . at present it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the default view is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor are sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under @-@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images that are burned in , due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights in the settings . the setting colors release some unusual results , as it shows the pointed lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast filling as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Rec@@ on@@ struction , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the de@@ fle@@ ction small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ scra@@ per . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction , as it is performed during the blan@@ king conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space to the other is thus the colors are as accurate as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile file S@@ ort here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
&quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures do not manage the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to do the color @-@ mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given back by a device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore work very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon &apos;s profile extension leaves the style for the finish : F for an exact style , L for landscape , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to collaborate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu , under Settings short commands . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . &quot;
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Discovery , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera bar . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; check whether &amp; digi@@ kam ; camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and ports manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option Vali@@ dation dialog for moving &gt; Pictures in the sleeve bin , you can set the conversation from &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly digi@@ ti@@ zed by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to apply the changes to the button edi@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you can also edit &amp; digi@@ code display of the welcome screen ; when you start , it may speed up &amp; edit the start button . &quot;
&quot; the setting Up after new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something was deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to adjust the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings in Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to fix and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Ad@@ ds / Edi@@ ting .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the picture editing section .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it , so you can save it by saving it . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the button The Rest@@ ore of Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . you can undo the last action by selecting and restoring undo by editing Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter the photo in and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the reference menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication coefficient automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will enter the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File Image menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . whole image templates can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Print Ass@@ ist from the menu Album Export . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the panel has a page bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available without the navigation column , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ h@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then stored . &quot;
&quot; next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of Ur@@ gency . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box that previously appeared in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ session keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of options when searching for a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering key words in a series of pictures . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword in the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , it will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word Fil@@ ters section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , keyword and search views are used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter shows no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it needs to be one or its , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; you can , for example , specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group group . the options are as follows : &quot;
why weren &apos;t Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r listed ? free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner come up with a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors that you print or publish in the web that appear from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed choices at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ book meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are via e @-@ mail or web where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color space and therefore have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to install my monitor if I decided to only work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to install your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ itor is working on s@@ RGB , then you either need to install your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , Automatic Comp@@ ensation and Con@@ trast added from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection will automatically attempt to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the Leu@@ k@@ amp values across the picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
&quot; compar@@ isons : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic sc@@ aling : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
enhance contrast : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a reset of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you can remove the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; this hist@@ ogram is very helpful since , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or dim them down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the chosen color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have placed can be saved to a text file , and later re@@ charge . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and the assignment of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is to use ton@@ er correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the color effects are four color effects , a Solar@@ is@@ ation@@ Eff@@ ect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created if you put a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and subsequently completed the development of the image . this was the effect that the lighter areas protected darker and the colors by the second light . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that so does not produce on photographic paper . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ is@@ ation@@ Eff@@ ect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result , and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can preview the various color extracts of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too much satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ force / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ ne correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three slide gates are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . previ@@ ew@@ ing is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set up whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column for images of a digital camera . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controllers : the upper@@ most for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
exit values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input ratings . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and later loaded again . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the preview of the original image for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most meaningful . in this case , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker excer@@ pts and that the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original photos is to see a red marker . if you want to change this selection to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p graph format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photograph taken in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel mixer for image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact . the left part of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to indicate the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ brau@@ schen . &quot;
&quot; saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for that purpose . you can store any mixer settings for later , then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . preserving the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter . &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film light with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscape and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold into the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the missing of a pressure and the re@@ development in a se@@ pi@@ racy . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified below ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce runs it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it is surrounded by a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : width of frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties like you need it . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply mould sten@@ cil you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image processing can be used to lay out sten@@ cils via a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to dimin@@ ish the file size of the template . so simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the Basic Fol@@ der button in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder was set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; reduce the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not shar@@ pen any bit , it works rather psych@@ ometric . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it does here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digital@@ isation process colours with only minimal differences to a color point . therefore , elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined into a common color . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequent sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the user . &quot;
&quot; images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a field of sharp@@ ness while reading the picture . if you disable this , you get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharp@@ ness tool@@ bar . you can use this with the menu entry Cor@@ rection Focus . &quot;
&quot; however , you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cra@@ cking . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ urs and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the Filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of an edge . high @-@ resolution images permit greater radi@@ i . you should therefore best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore plastic f@@ law in faces , cel@@ esti@@ al and water surfaces avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ming . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ming . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re @-@ focuss@@ ing colors in image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular F@@ itting works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular focus : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts , and the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is gau@@ ze . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have placed will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to do all cutting , color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations do not immediately visible changes that are not immediately visible , but later left uncomfortable art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ ring mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , un@@ sharp masks always have to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the slider sets the blur@@ ring of the area of the ink to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink tin@@ ts allow a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be preserved in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . &quot;
&quot; directional depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 only smooth@@ es in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ding or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value fitt@@ ingly to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be placed higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is tra@@ vers@@ ed . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ step @-@ wide since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the term . therefore , we recommend it to let it out . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground , that caused by a poor film shift during the journey . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on digital cameras sensor noise , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene taken with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny h@@ iss that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ windows advanced settings can remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the field of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is elevated , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges -@@ filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive Filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all the noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically stronger .
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter cushi@@ oning . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering range responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
store and store : these buttons are used for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have placed can be stored in the file system and then loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen an image . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration allows you to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gra@@ dation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; the buttons Save as and load do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ dation on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality rough @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . currently , there is no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button Dark Image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; cut : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under @-@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by setting the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as there is otherwise blur@@ red effects caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and colour or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation with a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2,0 , which is equivalent to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , respectively . &quot;
&quot; Leu@@ ch@@ intensity , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers provide you only positive values , since you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ strengthening and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient 4 Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can almost be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value has a stronger effect on margins than in the middle of the picture .
&quot; zoom : this value will scale the image size anew , resulting in a correction of the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive the image decreases . &quot;
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best , perform this correction as first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ed correction , the effect would be apparent to the groove . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal support line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . in the connection , you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black verti@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters setting film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gra@@ ined and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows become white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , since the color combinations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers are mixing large silver bas@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film particle effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value , although higher values are often required , can be adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film particle effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size image is 1 and smooth@@ en 17 .
the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob picks the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the engraving shows your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines from one center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al ir@@ regul@@ arity : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ev@@ sharpen@@ fe : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . it gives natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face which should stay free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the Trans@@ former turning or transforming mirrors . &quot;
&quot; photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools , in order to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality . &quot;
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Grid tab and are listed below :
&quot; keep the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be placed higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons &quot; &quot; Save as &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; loading &quot; &quot; are used for this purpose . any st@@ all@@ ying for photo can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; blowing your photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just have to use the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and raising the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply clicking with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries File Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of height and width is always assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog , you can use the Max . Rel@@ ation button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the help make it possible to fade in aid , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ thirds , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden centre : the gold center is a division based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational figure 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the gold center . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden centre provides liqu@@ e@@ fied cor@@ ps when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral , creating a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye falls into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points on the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can make a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options are mirr@@ ored and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the picture preview to position the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers Tri@@ mming from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is to cut the Automati@@ cally cutting function . choose one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after turning , but keep in mind the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the upper right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right hand corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right hand corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cutting off the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal setting , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using Horiz@@ on@@ tal An@@ gle and Ver@@ tical An@@ gle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the lubrication , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two insul@@ ations generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available hang from your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will be edited . you can change this list of file extensions . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . here more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understand these formats and will preview the movies . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit movies .

&quot; if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can do the first four alignment with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description follows here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , Un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; the upper part shows the original , and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo Features : show a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zoom out and move it while you click on the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described in the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color chart on the cur@@ sor . the color will be inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Cop@@ ying , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end character if another color follows . if therefore three numer@@ ical values are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ box . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the colour selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ gra@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ gra@@ vi@@ z ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate . re @-@ calculate the graph and present in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file was changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; instance , or want to present the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the previous option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice and change it later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page should be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and with another font
&quot; the Rec@@ over loading page gives you the option to specify behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program query each time . &quot;
&quot; the Open site gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher , if a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time it is asked . &quot;
&quot; the session management page gives you the option to specify the Start@@ ing behavior of &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) , or decide to be asked at each start afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which is normally displayed with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens new possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) , and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge blan@@ ks as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spring spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm classi@@ fies the k@@ not circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms specific options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or in@@ stituted ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed and ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this element ( if available ) .

adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbolic links . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons added ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent pixel or display ruler and adjust one @-@ color : or a chess board as transparency display . you can also set the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e Project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; if you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by selecting the default default duc@@ ts to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is displayed completely , otherwise some settings might not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the scanning button , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image by storing the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the Import &gt; Screen Photo ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
&quot; select the complete desktop , to read a single window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if All own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop reading , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should choose this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to give photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world and show your photos of your camera and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . so it is used for your authentication . so it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can sign up for Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is launched a second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the Add button should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the tag field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options , you can set the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading will be changed in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed to keep the aspect ratio constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog then appears . to load a possible correlation via time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time , so the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2,000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog box coordinates the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the relevant region and increase si@@ e.@@ Contact them over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not listed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the rider Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der preview pictures allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user as far as the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has generated the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program posts to determine if errors have occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to close the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse keys . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since there is no compression of the color information . for example , this can be found again in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool so you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor does not currently have any documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG @-@ enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG @-@ enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start creating the module via extras MPEG slide show . &quot;
&quot; the images you have selected are then listed in the image files in the portfolio , where you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it in black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start coding the production of the movie with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings on the bottom right below . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option is whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information from your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently , or later use them in other ways , you should not select the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG image in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . however , this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number of numbers and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation of the image , and the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can , for example , use this option to adjust your image to the screen size . &quot;
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the Add button . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them in order to add the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button Rem@@ ove Pictures , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after selecting all the images , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so that you can preview the status messages , search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the option File name displays the file name of the images in the left lower corner while the presentation is displayed .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option Pictures random@@ ly choose to show that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; between the pictures you can set the distance between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can pause and start presentation , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Back@@ ground image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have completed your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are displayed . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can save your own preview image for each person , which is of course also true for locations , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not own suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must choose which image to display for each individual person . to do so , you will need to open the image preview window ( described in closer ) and select the category editor in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the search in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image once more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched by this text . if you wish , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date may be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduction videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialogue , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time start , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in preview list@@ ings ) and also the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data . if you select a range , you will only see pictures of this period in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the menu File ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the moment and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages , you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this way , you can avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this way , those who look at your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download images that for example have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so , it can search your images with low resolution , which results in a smaller transfer time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select a folder or protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages are created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you still are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , properly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings you have just described have all been related to base folders or URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder will be created whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with these . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage to save all images into the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access through the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; at option Manual , copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the Automati@@ cally button to copy near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the option Export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option on this page is to limit the maximum picture size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu item ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories will be imported to the imported file , and which categories will match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you see pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) to set the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . a detailed help is available for each setting , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of explaining all groups of a member . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I , meaning &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . you can find information on this on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database first before you apply them to your own pictures using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t tell , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications attach their pictures into albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order after albums for some modules to make you use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview right now . &quot;
&quot; apart from the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , you will do so , so if you have selected persons to view it and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the picture is taken . for example , you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . &quot;
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; see three lists with a text field by using people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , because the names used are moved up , the people find and assign them more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sort by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right . &quot;
&quot; if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item More entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , you see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Not@@ ation dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window , by moving it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the window &apos;s appearance to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which , among other things , offers you the opportunity to store the current layout and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also fade out a box completely . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and then window a / off . this process can be viewed in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview of previ@@ ew@@ ing pictures of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the preview window . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and click either the Rem@@ ove button , or select Edit selection in the Edit selection menu . now , the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without you saved on your hard drive . of course , you must have saved the images somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not saved on the hard drive . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also preview these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if so , don &apos;t support it until now you want to avoid creating the CD . if so , please buy a bigger disk in order to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those left that you wish to make for others and click on Current View All except Current View . &quot;
&quot; with this you set out which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images to be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box at the top of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag and drop it . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see the appropriate entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have several images uploaded to the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the p@@ ush@@ button picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out the zoom button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom square is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key @-@ key you set the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos function in and zoom in with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look one after the other . &quot;
&quot; the two examples above give the viewer the possibility to tag pictures with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in this , you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have highlighted features on your pictures , these are available in the browser . so , if you want to print , print or whatever you have selected , just add them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can view categories in the Pre@@ view View , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later . &quot;
&quot; in order to exit the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood absolutely . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views . &quot;
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object as all objects are already selected with the object .
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to allow you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to take over these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click again on Apply or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of the property view . &quot;
&quot; click Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse over the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected , or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visual level chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the object properties view are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; in order to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , you draw the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map @-@ card fron@@ trun@@ ks in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating point views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginning to the desktop or click the small pointing arrow pointing left in the cham@@ fer bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with window arrangement view ... to save . it displays a dialog in which you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can type any name , it makes sense but a name that can be recognized by the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only one small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field Quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used to render . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user retro @-@ reflective light . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to l@@ essen the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and bin@@ ds &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is repeat@@ able depending on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the default threshold , then a grid of 4x4 incre@@ ments will be charged , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays hit no object .
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; unexpectedly , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here the path to your document and the version is supported . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height fel@@ lows ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristics .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid seper@@ ated for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you tick High detail@@ si@@ veness for extended projection , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick squar@@ ed smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . more precise information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section , it is explained how to create and store window orders . &quot;
drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column , you can create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with flash@@ cards you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
if you have installed all error @-@ free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tools of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ design view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you are creating . in particular , you notice it in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see for more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you click the Apply button or press the button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert End@@ licher body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also displays the plane , even at the moment only as a limited infinite plane . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object properties view . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but in the moment select something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ item . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows just a matt black material because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pig@@ mentation . therefore , always remember that you can review the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , click the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called one @-@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select always one color and change the colors in the object properties pane : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to do this step , as you should have understood the basic mode of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . the ball can be created just as easily as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the object properties pane , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you moved the floor around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ item and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input button .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of what possibilities are offered to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully you have learned so much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera ; the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously every scene that is to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be added to this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu entry if you have been using undo .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cuts , and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . with this option , you can modify or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option ; modify commands or add new ones . &quot;
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
&quot; a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any fle@@ x@@ or on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies , and these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , by applying an image file as color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether every image should be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background with the selected color is filled . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can display the program as well . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine whether the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the entry field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; show a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instruction to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the Beli@@ ze@@ indicators section , you can select the color that will be displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ wise should indicate the colors with what you should indicate . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure to a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a page bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can also find the same page bar in image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes as images to scan and save .
&quot; &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes as images to scan and save images . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before storing . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can &apos;t be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . he can adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if save is pressed , then the image will be saved and sh@@ it ? en route leads to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; output ; images can be selected . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each image sc@@ anned . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically to be saved images , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of the time when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; can@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up short@@ cuts ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this way you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions which can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser , and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
start require &apos; kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow you to run external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , each script itself has to take care of . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now add more information to the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tem@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tem@@ ples are also passed to allow the script to identify the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ custom@@ men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tem@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ate , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do for example cleaning up data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration may also install script packages downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script pack@@ ets with the expl@@ orer amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script pack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is finished , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . you may also find a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the Play@@ list browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , but if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable compile @-@ time with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requi@@ rements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; setup without difficulty setting up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; when displaying the player window , the player window will be added to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches off the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; creating an atmospheric setting : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled , so the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ ard voice files from the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
&quot; use other browsers : here , you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save play@@ lists when moving , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist at the end . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be stored . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keep up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute play during the piece change , making the play@@ lists window open / un@@ rolled to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing a piece to the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust the appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following range : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection user defined color scheme , you have the qu@@ al of choice and can set a custom color scheme . use the color selection activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; re@@ play at startup causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will continue automatically with the piece in place , with which it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color fields opens the dialog for color selection . if sel@@ e colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to suit your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate further adjustments in this card .
&quot; the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , which includes the folder and type of database for the collection . &quot;
&quot; here you can select the folder that is to be searched for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up , as with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to make changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination box Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : if the computer is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card card al@@ ig@@ ns the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current play .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; call similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included in it because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
usually this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b is compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to crashes while editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email will open automatically during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but don &apos;t label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script sol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; &quot; &quot; &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; Error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are easily forgotten . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can check this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the right version first . &quot;
&quot; most of the installation problems are solved by the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only insert a bug there if there is something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do pieces of music come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the interface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Select . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short command . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From playlist removed from the drop down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no ! yes , that really is ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be : which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ MM ? . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder included in the default ( for patent @-@ related reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Regi@@ stered &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously generate audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different link ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ders it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see the next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x issues problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Code@@ cs that can cause distorted playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I &apos;d like to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . run register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok in advance ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . &quot;
please report about it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides the name contains the magical K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the soft tones of music that you have stopped going to bed . &quot;
how to get to know the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok if you &apos;re working on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file is present .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right click puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the control bar &apos;s system section ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display . &quot;
&quot; my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio CD to play . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ string ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this adap@@ ts the previous rating with a declining value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can set the rating for a piece yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the playlist window . there , you can edit the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : select review or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Met@@ adata dialog . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan that does not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select setup tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to browse and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or browser . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then , click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu . &quot;
audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install again . &quot;
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the bug There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok &apos;s second sound card ?
&quot; set up Amar@@ ok under Settings ... Audio output , type the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check with sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported further . of course you are welcome to take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed tut@@ or for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . &quot;
&quot; create a playlist is very easy . use the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them by using the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio track protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
&quot; the Bur@@ n function is also in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the Bur@@ n menu . here , you have several options for burning a CD . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some extra packages are listed that make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok can be used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window is a scroll display showing the current piece or the currently running stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio @-@ analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ ders . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or the previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 preferences , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the equ@@ ali@@ zer box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub @-@ window is dropped off . the information presented there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to im@@ itate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images can have any name , but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images , which have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded items , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recei@@ pts are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist .
&quot; you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will pop up and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in each area to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Search button will open a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com following the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - group@@ ed only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - In addition , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further distribution is performed according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter is ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your pieces are listed first by genre , and among them by artist . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist . &quot;
&quot; using the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; below the search filter there is a selection box with which you can filter out the last added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time frames , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the Collection Browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
&quot; to attach to playlist , add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will achieve the same effect . &quot;
set pieces in queue mode - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section about the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will enable the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the piece information dialog and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Del@@ ete files into the bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; undo the compilation @-@ mark - change the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed under various interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list browser is easy to use with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser includes the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces listed on your iPod by interpreter in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can access the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping files . in that case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply typing the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the list . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left hand side , you can find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the buttons for undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many other buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the visualization plug @-@ ins window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . choose from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management got your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random items during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : audio c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
&quot; double click the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then select Lo@@ ad . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists receive pieces begin with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New Rel@@ eases the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped , and no piece will be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . &quot;
plays - this is the number of pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , then the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random items from each of the selected play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on script . it will open a selection dialog , where you can choose a script package for installation . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also download new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script to be deleted and then uninstall it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
&quot; the Dialog window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins is used to enable the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to create a CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to follow the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re@@ coding to MP3 you will receive a po@@ orer quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog box that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium for the data to be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&quot; to fix this problem , run q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) . &quot;
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and learn about news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions , which also offers &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competitor to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; m@@ peg is for example possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD , for example .@@ de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a help program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the pieces of music play differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge newly opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as you would call for each single project file Save .
&quot; if a project has been modified and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . also , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen , just as if you have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project that is not saved , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you have called a file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to run the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the what is the ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . &quot;
&quot; this also allows copying a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD that you can then burn later . the converting / reduction of a DVD using the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the medium medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created CD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all@@ stand@@ alone . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and trimm@@ ing black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view switches on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content View lets you select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , where general programming settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality of the program , so your taste and type of task is crucial in addition to which of the programs you provide . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you are using d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be applied to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar

&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ j@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to circum@@ vent any copy protection . if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called as often as a suitable configuration ) , afterwards the daily use to read a &amp; CD will be explained . this will lead ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can fetch &amp; CD ; get information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , all of which is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step @-@ by @-@ step example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB will start request of CD@@ DB data according to the installation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der has been configured in the Code of Con@@ figuration Settings in the setup directory - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ ders , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely top quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , upload the information , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( referring to the translator : this is meant by the author ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being har@@ med by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than those used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has verified the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers . &quot;
&quot; a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this hasn &apos;t happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the recorded WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution concerned , before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; after installing a coding , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ c &amp; etc ; ) might be installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found using a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that will probably only be done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program with which fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is transferred to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if there is more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive available , a look inside the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the tab card General Settings . here is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; just select for incomplete information , so that you will be notified when information on generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand . however , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server about the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . &quot;
&quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work synchron@@ ously with the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ xed the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf online . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; simultaneously reading pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine , it is possible to code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is set up because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; input data manually , rather than fet@@ ching them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , look for help in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet . &quot;
&quot; e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor , input the CD data and the title of the first piece &quot;
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the entry field &quot; &quot; Current Tit@@ le &quot; , &quot; the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; input field , unless you have a set of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom commentary box can be used for individual comments in individual pieces , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the fre@@ ed@@ b data , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously corresponds to the style of the CD . in this example , this is not important since we do not give the &amp; CD ; data will not be communicated anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BO@@ M .
&quot; note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the selection process started by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab Job for switching to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message will show you , if you try to work with a enco@@ der you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . resp@@ . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs has many variations on settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? if you read this , you probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may do it . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( real @-@ time events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure you use .
&quot; session support . if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , k@@ mid will start again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu File . it will appear the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the File Play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played in succession . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as pressing the button Pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used so that you do not have to manually set the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to set an event type , select text events or real estate events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can sum@@ mar@@ ise . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click here to New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the values in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . consider this if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add a song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automati@@ cally Add to the collection .
&quot; when Automati@@ cally Add to the Collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if Automati@@ cally Add to the Collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next Song button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , to skip a song , select the Pre@@ vious item , the Pre@@ vious item from the menu item or press the arrow button on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need any MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all the necessary re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except for the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . pre@@ condition for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you can see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be provided for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
&quot; note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument need to tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun shot ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each tone represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the pitch means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
&quot; Key@@ boards are used above all to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . for example , look at the included key@@ boards . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can , for example , be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are available . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that will play a pitch benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards will try to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards , you see which sounds are being played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to show the played sounds . in the Settings menu select Settings under the point Channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn on the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then decide to play B.@@ Sch@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have a lot of spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , please contact me ( if you want it ) . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t get any money for it . I want to stress that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; my thanks also is to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , bug alert or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD s , V@@ CD s , or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after one another , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and persistent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select play@@ lists from the same menu and either select the edit mode or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 of the option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / app@@ .x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the view of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp;
&quot; there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the &amp; KM@@ Player configuration dialog . here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything has to be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sign@@ ments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the Back@@ end Output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , this should be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; S@@ MB ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings is to be found in - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there , ports should be detected from which one is selected . the code to be used must be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ d in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . &quot;
&quot; for the source , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d source , ex@@ it@@ source , ect@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source are used . when activated , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why does my CPU have to be checked for its performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required to compile &amp; dump .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; box ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you want to compile &amp; check , add to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .@@ net@@ . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; box ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphic interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; to find out more about &amp; kate , the manual to Kate should be drawn up . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ y ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master correctly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
&quot; document categories : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , Let@@ ter &#91; report &#93; , Report &#91; DIN &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as a standard . at best should U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users do not have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; with automatic breach of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; box ; it automatically creates a blank line ( for typing the text ) and the corresponding line to the commands of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled . &quot;
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI @-@ file &#91; device independent file ) is created , ski@@ ps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF , the output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the back search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are plu@@ cked with the editor and once clicking on an element in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , you will jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be configured to project project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no bugs in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file will be &quot; &quot; clean &quot; , &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick implementation of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box For further information is to add articles such as keywords , notes , notes or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , picture , or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice of selection field possible ) .
the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; box ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e will be used for setting the font size . you can specify the font size for the main text , the notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex must be compiled . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically removes the storage .
&quot; if the compilation of the document is missing , errors should be searched for errors . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font size . &quot;
the changes are only monitored within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex is shown , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for better legi@@ bility of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the case of an internal observer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output , such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed with file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows to convert the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI @-@ file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , it can begin to convert into other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
pre@@ v search provides direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; only need to set up Modern under Settings box ... Building up tools .
&quot; to execute the preview search , the mouse cur@@ sor must be positioned in a row of the source code and click on preview search . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as text editor ( Setup Ok@@ ular ... Editor )
&quot; should an error occur , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the protocol file contains the source code error source . in the editor , the button Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for le@@ verages between the errors . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting blank document , a document can either be written from scratch or used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file needs to be opened or a new file is created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in a document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex file , a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; box ; used &amp; kate . as an internal editor . &amp; kate . is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to find out more about and to know its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be accessed through the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex and its syntax .
double @-@ click with a cli@@ cked C@@ tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; that means that when you click on \ \ par \ \ \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with a modified Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and to emphasize them . for example the &amp; lat@@ ex works differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
&quot; many assistants can incorporate additional jump handles . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit jump handles or the corresponding key component enable the jump to the next or last jump brand . thereby , this jump stamp is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; kate . although &amp; kate . already excellent possibilities , have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code always supports selection . under Edit selection , the following commands for text selection are included : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , and all other lines of the source code . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex , commands , and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning , as this command also has an extended meaning ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; kate . offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders in the Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jumps to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , quick overview can be lost . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ ly brackets of a &amp; tex ; group # is jumped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted braces groups braces can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple quotes are used as a substitute . for the useful implementation is used in &amp; box ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple quotes . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; know this case and add two conclu@@ ding quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double quotes can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used to specify language specific settings ( e.g. German or French ) and thus German or French trademarks . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when using Shift key , En@@ ter key &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users want to sort the columns in tables -@@ surroundings and thereby all t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to invent it . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; ki@@ le ; according to the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the above line . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the corresponding column , add some space for the columns position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate . already a good source code completion offers , this was added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; these are built for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { environment } and box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and allows the list to be completed . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , you can log in from &amp; box , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by clicking the jump handles Next , and the desired parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Con@@ figur@@ ing settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as extensions of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there must always be a few characters entered with \ \ begin and the execution mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the surroundings are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling full stop mode to select the environment or key signature Alt + Shift key Space key , the command to open the environment is automatically logged in and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the ambient charge can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be executed . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex , commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box ... for example , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode introduced over the menu editing or key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large ter@@ restri@@ als are not helpful for automatic bre@@ aches . however , it has been found that many bodies in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion of all written bets . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu &quot; &quot; Ki@@ le ... &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the capture files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche Home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ alogue Graphi@@ cs incorporate the inser@@ tion of graphics as easy as possible . in view of the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and respected . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is needed , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus Cre@@ ating , converting and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the other conversion can be used by pressing Alt + 2 . thereafter , the DVI @-@ file can be converted to a PS file in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , and can be viewed using Alt @-@ 5 , the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the fast @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after compile . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time . &quot;
&quot; a new project will be about the project &quot; &quot; New Project .... &quot; &quot; the following information will be asked for the project : &quot;
&quot; when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
&quot; first of all , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ones . because this is a very large document , it is divided into three key book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extra@@ di@@ ted , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the boxes &amp; boxes ; supplied documents and this for a graphical surface area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the greater advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer to the document .
&quot; &amp; box ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; desktop environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; thanks to those who strive for the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; with the command line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is read by &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you an lt ; empty signature ; in the signature section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always sufficient signatures . &quot;

&quot; the status of a particular holding function is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color . the desired color can be selected : see in the Edi@@ tor@@ Settings dialog , page colors . &quot;
&quot; you can de@@ activate or delete a holding point using keys , the Deb@@ u@@ g menu or the icons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; will be inter@@ cep@@ ted and either in the inspection ... dialog or in &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; -@@ output window shown . the following exceptions apply from this rule :
&quot; the various tools are available via the Deb@@ ug@@ gen menu , where the in@@ spi@@ king tool is most important . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a step @-@ by @-@ step guide in the menu , a dialog will appear for the choice of the exp@@ ir@@ ation speed . &quot;
&quot; to stop the process , press the W key or select step @-@ by @-@ step execution in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to set up a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; catalog , select System@@ ID ... in the menu and enter the value to be searched for in the dialog displayed . &quot;
&quot; to post a Pub@@ lic@@ ID , select Pub@@ lic@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the value to be searched in the dialog displayed . &quot;
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen In@@ spi@@ encing ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the tab for the source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; source files included in the &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking on a source application in the shown list puts the text po@@ inter in the main window to the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen In@@ spi@@ encing ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the tab for the source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all found templates are listed here . it must be noted that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T are valid . therefore several templates can be present with the same matches and mode details .
clicking on a template in the shown list moves the text hand in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code in which a global and a local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; if it contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when you click a variable entry in the list , the text hand in the main window will be transferred to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has known mein@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it one piece or give it a graphical interface ! just click on the icon for the XML processor and finished !
&quot; this application expects inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the binary working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the open file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then just select the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the related errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply hoo@@ ked . if not , delete the check with current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check option . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then let the current file be selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection file . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality instantly and do not have to wait until someone uses the bog@@ us in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the Edit menu . thus , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . add plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event for information to team leaders can be created when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the Side Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note input is simple . you can either select the comment entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by Not@@ ation text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the first name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Manager After the Area and Sub@@ project leaders should be given the appropriate domain or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the braces and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed with it . entries are :
&quot; large / Small @-@ case of tags : large / Low @-@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal upper / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ .@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Small letters of attributes : large / Small letters of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if attached , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically update the start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by using the standard button you can restore the default settings .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regularly create backup copies , so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash when the program is started . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has been mess@@ ed up by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks out of no longer query .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree . &quot;
&quot; the structure tree settings area can set the visibility of knots in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing , and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such , where no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins are part applications from the third side , which can be re @-@ used by any node @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the following must be specified when adding a plug @-@ in : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
loading component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plugin : if this is checked , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations of plu@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin selection field , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it is not necessary to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to variables and current line number . if this happens while a script is requested , execution will continue . if it happens before a request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is requested . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script , but if it is possible to clean up in functions and include . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set to set a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is one &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works from Keith .
this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility make aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tags / D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic links of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) , which can insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing failure . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folder . they only contain the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders will carry the name of the description language and version , so exist . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . by using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
&quot; sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag , which is a single element type element . &quot;
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally there are other tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source code used to fill out the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ing together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces should be replaced by &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
here is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . to edit a &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; release 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set with Settings Activities ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut has been assigned to this action . clicking the &quot; &quot; Custom &quot; &quot; button can be used to assign a key abbrevi@@ ation ; with K@@ 1 the current key abbrevi@@ ation can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings , and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / scripts / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / removed from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is automatically added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be entered by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field you can specify what to send to the default input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , to the default error output . it can be specified , what should be done with the output written on the default output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings Activities . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action Button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; Edit Tag &quot; if available so that you can input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Gra@@ ph other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start is called , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this icon will be inserted ; tag ; tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with Settings action ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to the tool@@ bar for a better overview .
&quot; after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by cutting all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ pedi@@ Fol@@ ders , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user , the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has already done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = table of contents , # get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for shaft depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script will display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of related context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and convert to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified this in your do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the fail resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different locations there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send tool bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scrip@@ ting tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and sig@@ nage . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in tag@@ .@@ XML format . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; doc@@ type Defini@@ tions Code : the string that should appear in the ! doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / W3@@ C / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand and take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked as globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special promotions , especially for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ fies the common use of special tools and samples of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the cart@@ on guides with information and the tool@@ bars . please propose and for more information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all anti@@ trust leader , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area will lead to another context menu with regard to the processed document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copying / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste ; insert into your document , then click the tag that represents the tag . now you can fill the data for this straight @-@ in day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box various fields . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc ; there are all options open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on the connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can download the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens up in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ quickly can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented application system allows to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are some ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively developed and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ dable mark@@ up language editor would do ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing , what anyone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when past@@ ing from the cli@@ p@@ board , converts the special characters to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting reference . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , which is the correct way to paste special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
switch on or off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key .
this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; displays the message window or not . this is the window , where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
switch on and turn on the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. , copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... . tool bars are saved using tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows you to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or someone else has done and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened without updating the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and is not available in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu Standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; in the Plugins section , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click them . clicking on an activated plugin will disable it . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; -@@ version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or create un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the tab card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry will activate the appropriate sub@@ window . &quot;
switches the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which add and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , as for example , after filling out the project name , the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here is the server address of the machine to which you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the remote host configuration , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . when a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; check if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started anew from scratch , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can select an exact selection according to your own discretion . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or changed using the Shift + F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are completely ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by atta@@ ching your own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn off event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders are also active , but the entries open and open with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in memory and forget about programs . this option is useful when up@@ loading files is needed and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk does not come into question .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way is to use the tool@@ bar menu . use and adding are different . adding tool bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog where actions on this or other tool bar are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings Activities .
&quot; templates are basically complete document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates .
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more specialized documents are ne@@ sted in corresponding sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this type of template is useful , if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can contain everything from a comment on a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . see for more information about the template tree . &quot;
&quot; they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure as you want ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) , and select File As Tem@@ plate as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template saving selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copying the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or paste over the account tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right and choose site template to enter and back a name for the template . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each folder is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to set a folder &apos;s behavior , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties from the Properties menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; if a root folder is so set , it would disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably will find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; allows leading or downstream text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project , allowing by copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) using a complete command file for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and turn back to source editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in sync . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source editor can be adjusted via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast machines and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called upon when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this allows the reduction of the manual coding . thus , you can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file .
&quot; it is possible to use the cur@@ sor as in text processing , moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . text can be inserted by typing and by using back button or removed button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other tag anchor must be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars such as the table wizard or the Listen wizard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to be used in this release to use the tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be pursued .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successfully , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatible mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a file name without path specification . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ ot@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a default named QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; is extended by the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extends to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
&quot; this is automatically done when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . after the start of each pass , re@@ taining points are checked again . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diffusion ? ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during merging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines . and there was no indication of the positions , where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later any number of additional useful functions have been added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting output . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the merge @-@ merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and follow the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folders
&quot; the Open dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; via the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the Comp@@ are and merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field for target is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop @-@ down : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; if you want to find out how much these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , then upload them to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can easily copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merging ) well . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file does not have rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with a broken line . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) has also an info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ modify &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compare windows are used , each difference is simultaneously a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes by automatic merging , or by manual editing , there is no more line left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no row in the list . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you may change your mind and perhaps yet another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a selection that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options Ign@@ ore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate up mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , bottom , page , end , end , string beginning and string end , as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image Up / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ paste ) . &quot;
&quot; Unix flavors do not use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the len@@ ders of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when moving and restored to the next start . ( Menu Adju@@ st@@ ment &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered more ast@@ er@@ ised . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically displays an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when the tab@@ ul@@ ator key is pressed . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press En@@ ter or Return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copying the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the usual selection on the used operating system .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . also when merging white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic advanced mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before jumping to the next un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
&quot; these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . for details , see documentation for comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; modify the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program currently running . you need to quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
over the selection fields for the coding a short notice appears what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; modify the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands . &quot;
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded transitional column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first committed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only in line balance . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it for themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are perfectly sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line balance to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated string ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword sub@@ stitution . you can change the list as needed . the \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processor command for po@@ inters . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can use something different , e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l some details are different . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line distance al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line comparison pre@@ processor looks at the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without actually performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog box .
&quot; if three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; when you read the folder , a small message window will inform you about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files will be listed , which were compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folders is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window displaying results on the left side , ... &quot;
every file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when double @-@ clicking on a file , the file comparison will start and a comparison window will appear . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . for folders , age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option directories are active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action so that both folders will be identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the New File instead of merge , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; when merging , one file is executed after the other . it shows your status column when merging is successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a last check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the merged actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , you will use C as target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ merge mode , and B and / or B will be used as destination for synchron@@ izing . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid combination actions due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options Per@@ mit , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select the directory merge again / resume , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , an appropriate dialog appears . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them later . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ format@@ ted files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be customized with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous dot marks a file than hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; in case of links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is disabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folder and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diffusion ) . a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diffusion . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to trust in the date of change . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this may , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected to be identical . the results of merging files are saved in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging , copying the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , as it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folders @-@ merge @-@ view will remain visible during the merging of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text windows . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . you can also merge a single file directly , without having to start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an ft@@ p server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
&quot; a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things , you should note : &quot;
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol you use . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or a folder . then , a file will always be accepted as link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permission or change date . therefore , the cre@@ denti@@ als or the date of change will devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a node , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; suppose the input file is a patch file in unified format . then takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program starts to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name &quot; &quot; K@@ Di@@ ff &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; K@@ Diff@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ( now hot ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by st@@ aking in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or are going to go that way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file , you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this will is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text you should use another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ eps ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does this mean , and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ ron@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir puts the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . ) &quot;
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , it is missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . variations in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if you click on the empty background from &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with Order numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the current programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty spaces will be displayed to enable the selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal and vertical line , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with its content . in addition , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up sel@@ ector switch ... let the dialog settings appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c file with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or log in to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated for new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window or the environment of the mouse @-@ screen at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor settings . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse cur@@ sor . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the select window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and shift the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press &amp; Shift key , or Shift &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down box . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the ad update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically re@@ charge your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and decreasing &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can zoom &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to do this , use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually handic@@ apped . &quot;

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor persi@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick provides pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor persi@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and to which every mou@@ sec@@ lick can em@@ ulate pain . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not been done yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and triggers a mouse click as soon as you break the movement short .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it has em@@ ulated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click will execute .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Move is switched on , the shooting range is enabled ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is shut down , the mouse button is left to release if there is no moving mouse over time . &quot;
&quot; this feature activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the specific documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after pressing the Apply . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all , with the Pre@@ ferences . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce &amp; k@@ de response times ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click will remain without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you clean not only the mouse sphere , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse sphere . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the so@@ iling easily with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using intelligent moving , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can even run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . however , you can park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and move it again or perform any other action when you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart shift if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while holding the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will every time you click &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . later , you will know exactly when the shift time begins with intelligent moving . later , you can also use the intelligent moving without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window must be installed , which should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor remains short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to be activated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can also be configured to wait a certain time , that a drawing process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer talk for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases that are to be spoken once again from a list with the conversation history . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pas@@ si@@ diary . you can often choose text passages from text passages without typing them . of course , the text passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can match the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only properly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word completion . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth &quot; &quot; is clearly arranged and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that should be repeated again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page Word supplement as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the speech card , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding and the text will be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as default . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text pas@@ sage@@ way menu or in the menu bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; when you choose So@@ fort , the selected text passage is directly spoken and added to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . if you select Add to the input field , the selected text passage will only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , close the editing window for text pas@@ sage@@ ways , you can determine if the text passage book should be saved automatically when closing the processing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you select any changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ way will not be saved . if you want to save changes , ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ way should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word completion page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how to weigh them . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for processing text passages is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ sage@@ way , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either click on the choice in the menu bar , the tool@@ bar or by using a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text block is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text block is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drawing , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth will be displayed . if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drawing , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for speech output correct or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map speech output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without further restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ t folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ ve@@ file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax happily swal@@ lowed the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
&quot; ( cat - , echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v &quot;
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; - further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the language generator setting is only performed at K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; you can use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog ; it appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , send text by the computer . it is stored a list of already spoken phrases that the user can always re@@ pay . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading of texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; kate . , even if &amp; kate . embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output is done using the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the creation of language output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , there are discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ mailing list instead of . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ related . &quot;
&quot; before you can , you need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set it correctly . &quot;
&quot; for the first start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card holder will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the tab card is displayed in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher will otherwise use the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the anti@@ trust card tra@@ der in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card holder will appear . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all speakers already established appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts system .
&quot; choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the tab General and check if speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to be enabled so that the T@@ TS service starts from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the tab order to create and manage text orders .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language output system ; click the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card order will be displayed , and you can create text orders and read . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and check the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; on , if the field speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the control bar when it is read , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the cart@@ on card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read and select Tools menu in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed first . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select Tools menu in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
this also works if &amp; kate . embedded in other applications as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the information system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events defined by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the menu Settings menu . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filters are processed in filters before it is sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the modus oper@@ and@@ i , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other jobs and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the reserved jobs are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order you use from the card order is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reading , this output will stop and stop . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages , and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
&quot; string replacing parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string replacing filters , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format .
&quot; you can use Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filters to send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice for example on the card card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a notification , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it will be processed by all activated filters placed on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for setting string replacement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you will receive the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . die &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copy . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box are applied to filters . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replaced filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . so the words must be del@@ im@@ ited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package ambig@@ u@@ ls . &quot;
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the Inter@@ phone selection filter lets you send text to a specific speaker set up on the card card , or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker characteristics which the program gives , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it sends , and the properties of the actors set up on the map card . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can access it with a click on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialogue selection selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the ch@@ ute selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ese Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , meaning &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ over@@ s API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice delivery services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; s , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use for a list of all commands .
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the above speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my speech . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Video Converter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation notes seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ ards are spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string substitute filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the accompanying documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can click &amp; kt@@ ts to download the package . you can also download the source code from k@@ de@@ pressed under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or obsol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . check also on the kt@@ ts page ; , according to information that is not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ izer . if you want to expand it for the use of any other synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the package k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts source text from the source text archive , or downloaded the tar@@ ball that you have created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if the speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is designed to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentence or paragraph style , repeat or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have created a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it is used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click Add on the card card , and in order for a speaker to insert in the list or click Edit , the flash@@ card reader device will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active is shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to the modules below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . when voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider lets you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few controls and display this grey , the voice you &apos;ve chosen doesn &apos;t allow you to adjust these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the symbol in the system section to see the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the or@@ ator ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokesman . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can go ahead or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be adopted and t@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed here . issues of Screen Re@@ ading , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . for more information about the message types by &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules appear in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you choose AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ th ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ mm ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the reserved jobs are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the issues of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to let &amp; kt@@ ts ; read Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch on &amp; k@@ de noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and des@@ kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , al@@ erts where a sound is played is not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter the speaker &apos;s properties here . standard will select the speaker that will appear in the list on the tab card as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the previous noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . ss@@ ml is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ th ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide the text into individual sentences . thus , you can proceed faster with reading , as only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ limit identi@@ fier filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch on the selection selection and enter text to read . switch on the choice of speakers again , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s choice changes . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then start reading faster with reading , since only the first movement has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long , &quot;
&quot; then you can pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer is not supported . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal limit identi@@ fier filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation , and add a tab ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text in front of the filter ) . note that the default pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional limit filter , you can insert it again by loading the in &amp; kt@@ ts ; contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the card list , you can over@@ ride the application settings for the application . &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the card card spokesman ) . in other words : no spokes@@ persons are specified .
&quot; use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the features of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is closest to the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a primary feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the features in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click the standard speaker and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr r@@ ushes off immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output on AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes and kt@@ ts ; a . on the console ; a message appears , which says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA may occur which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / resol@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide , please send a patch along with the URL , where you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed on the card &apos;s menu . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ selected . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml converter filter , and set up the subscri@@ ber speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; with Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert SS@@ ml to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab , orders are displayed , the order exists only from one sentence . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you can not filter the pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ality detection instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered , before using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; in connection with AL@@ SA , some users experience conflicts in audio output . if your system counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freeze if you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the subscri@@ ber speed , but is otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or created at least only on request . &quot;
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have run time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS environment variable , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ gard echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; inst @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . in addition , you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the votes MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) code , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution distri@@ butions . look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the code option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over le@@ xi@@ kal@@ ische analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this slide . festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for german &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; , then download MS German Festival from &quot;
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the setting of the error correction is not required ; you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines into the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .
&quot; ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 3 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems , you must edit the / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m file . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to give the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . get it and install yourself first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file Festival must be in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ched speech synthes@@ izer that currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
fl@@ ite is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . search Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language synthes@@ izer generates the sound from it . language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;

&quot; epic is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ched speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak langu@@ age@@ . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . click Add to the tab . click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epic T@@ TS speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if the Epo@@ s programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the tab . enter in one &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ aned speech synthes@@ izer which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor subscri@@ ber speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use a command , which writes the speech output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed through selection of K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file has been designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf create a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the module network settings will be loaded , if the option Network Settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which is best suited to distribution and release . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . prior to that , all options are gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
&quot; the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the device you want in the list and clicking the button interface ... set up in the Dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the manual selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface for bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch on an obsol@@ ete network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking Interface . &quot;
&quot; establishes the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communications with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the host name resolution calcul@@ ator allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be placed in the list with the buttons on or down in the list with the buttons . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... dialog Edit is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of officially known hosts describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of officially known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... The New ali@@ ases dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press de button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog Know@@ n Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
installing the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
installing the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console ; using rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second chapter , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently operating with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely distributed . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point to which a valid IP address is applicable or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs according to a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of already set tasks and related environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded . &quot;
&quot; with a de@@ activated task , program names and parameters are not displayed and the description appears de@@ activated . &quot;
the environment variables that appear here set out the otherwise existing environment variables for all specified tasks except power . when a de@@ activated variable appears as a description disabled .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the Tas@@ ks folder . then go to the Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can also click the Tas@@ ks folder with the right mouse button and in the new context menu New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to start . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press Selec@@ ting .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; if you select both Mon@@ thly ( s ) and week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be performed on a suitable date as well as an appropriate day of the week . if you select for example the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on 1st and 15th of the selected months independent of the day of the week , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a job , first select the task to remove . then go to Edi@@ ting Cut . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select cut out , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select copying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a job , first one has to be cut or copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then is inser@@ ting available at all . select the Tas@@ ks folder . then go to Edit In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can use the right mouse button to click on the tasks folder and select Add , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a job , first select one . then go to the Edit Pan@@ e menu item ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and change ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog task in which you , as described above , can edit the chosen task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task to delete . then go to the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select it and determine the state with the Edit activation menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in its description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the task with the right mouse button and select En@@ able . after activating , make sure the program name , parameters and description are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to perform a task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the Edit New@@ f menu item . &quot;
alternatively you can use the right mouse button to click on the variable folder and select New ... or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables . click the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the rec@@ alled program to another than the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes are made only when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then go to Edi@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the variable and select copying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to include an environment variable , first one has to be cut or copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then is the option inser@@ ting at all . select the variable folder . then , go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to be processed . then go to Edit Change ... Altern@@ atively , you can use the right mouse button on the variable and modify ... Select options to edit the variable , in which , as described above , you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click the right mouse button on the variable and select Activ@@ ated . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do so , select the File Save menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only become active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard k@@ de ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose folding shut@@ ters , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedules of the users . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted in creating a surface for tar , which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; cle@@ ars the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the p@@ act on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you will be asked if the index has to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was included . in the Status Bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be recognized by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
&quot; before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive pres@@ upp@@ oses that a tape has to be format@@ ted before being used , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted from the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do not require disk format@@ ting , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat runs ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after the format@@ ting process is completed , the tape is automatically included and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be backed up . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
ri@@ ght@@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been taken , the dialog opens Settings for Backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will appear . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear settings for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears over@@ viewing . this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ establish the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select File Recovery ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog appears re@@ producing . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape file by means of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be watched will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up , which are located on the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file against tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , it will automatically be dis@@ car@@ ded when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to share the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only document a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with the host@@ name of the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the time the volume has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are provided to easily filter and sort the log lines of a log file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . if you do not see this , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteria or after entered strings . in addition , enter a string in the filter bar . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter contains the entry All . then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . in addition , in the protocol file system protocol , select the name of a process , so show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a conspic@@ uous color as log lines of level indicator . the color representation of protocol rows can be turned off set @-@ up dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the Add to new lines to be enabled in the main window contex@@ tual menu to display all new additions to the protocol . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , earlier known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when starting the system in the &amp; Linux world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not deal with historical aspects here ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important , because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without creating a re@@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . this is why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to run when starting the system or switching to another running level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be located in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches for the program in@@ it at various points and starts the first one it finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default level 3 is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have done something , then come repair by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original running level ( or its position ) . this only happens when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them to a new level . to copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another running level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the product number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are extracted from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard levels , and now the machine starts constantly anew . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the entry button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under running level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just quit if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that it can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation by &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings . &quot;
&quot; if shadow passwords , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes , the password management card will appear . &quot;
&quot; this card only appears if space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least an embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the limitations of space in KB are : &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the File system , with space limitation . &quot;
&quot; the Groups tab informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , belonging to the user , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ alogue Properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boat manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot of the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
