<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the topmost folder that contains pictures, as base folder. & digikam; view any subfolder as album. no image will be altered."</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; thirsts recursively the library path in its entire depth. you can't exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folder. this allows you to paste a point in front of the folder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albian list do not have photos as icons. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>

<seg id="75">"photo 2 is a free, further distributable software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgPhoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that thumbnails can be read out reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to drag thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules for all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in almost any way, as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop pictures everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbaum, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. in this way, filtering on the filename will only work if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos that were edited by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date on which the album was created first."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album import pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select Edit Properties in the contextual menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped by a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos after collection. if you want to add or delete collections from the toolbar collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"buttons Elder, average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first image will be selected in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albengstequot;. this is intended to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& edited; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. of course you can use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window will show you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be displayed in this album in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"if you open an album the first time, you need to wait short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this in which you can regenerate all preview images in the Extras menu."</seg>

<seg id="139">"from the preview toolbar, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window. if you select preview from the toolbar and perform zoo or move operations at one of the pictures, then these are also executed in the other picture. you can thus compare the same area of the two images."</seg>
<seg id="140">"another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pairs of pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it on the left. this simplifies it through a number of similar images."</seg>
<seg id="141">"of course, normal delete actions work directly from the light table like F4 File Edit..."</seg>
<seg id="142">"all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. for example, this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure information."</seg>

<seg id="147">"& quot; Digital stock management assumes, indexes, categorizes, secures, seeks, transforms, confeces and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value."</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">"I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no stock management to find a particular photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digikam;. the approach to save the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the first thing you need to do and know before you include anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; please note that you need to switch to a larger drive at some point."</seg>
<seg id="151">"you may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; Export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard."</seg>

<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency.

<seg id="239">TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG is a licensed and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed due to the need to unify the camera image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obligates to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers now provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to embed the & quot; Image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits to it because it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models.

<seg id="301">"the default view is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor are sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">"this setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card photographed in the sunlight."</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that under-exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images that are burned in, due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights in the settings. the setting colors release some unusual results, as it shows the pointed lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try some parts of missing information from the top lights to reconstruct."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast filling as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the option Reconstruction, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the deflection small, you should proceed conservatively."</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dscraper. it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, balance, Automatic Compensation and Contrast added from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction will automatically attempt to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the Leukamp values across the picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"comparisons: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic scaling: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Enhance contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a reset of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you can remove the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"this histogram is very helpful since, even in well-lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or dim them down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the chosen color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons Save as and Load make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have placed can be saved to a text file, and later recharge."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and the assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to use toner correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the color effects are four color effects, a SolarisationEffect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created if you put a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and subsequently completed the development of the image. this was the effect that the lighter areas protected darker and the colors by the second light. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that so does not produce on photographic paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the SolarisationEffect. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result, and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can preview the various color extracts of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too much saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukforce / contrast / gamma, the tool tonne correction is located to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three slide gates are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. previewing is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. on the left side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set up whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column for images of a digital camera. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controllers: the uppermost for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammages."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input ratings. the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and later loaded again. to do this, the Gimp level format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette to use and click on the preview of the original image for red, green, blue and luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not sharpen any bit, it works rather psychometric. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it does here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the digitalisation process colours with only minimal differences to a color point. therefore, elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined into a common color. SLR cameras usually require more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for the user."</seg>
<seg id="484">"images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a field of sharpness while reading the picture. if you disable this, you get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpness toolbar. you can use this with the menu entry Correction Focus."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally: sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cracking. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the menu item Correcurs and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of an edge. high-resolution images permit greater radii. you should therefore best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharper and therefore plastic flaw in faces, celestial and water surfaces avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocussing refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filming. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filming. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by re-focussing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular Fitting works much better than the Gauß 's folding. the Gauß' s folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular focus: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts, and the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is gauze. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocused parameters you have placed will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to do all cutting, color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations do not immediately visible changes that are not immediately visible, but later left uncomfortable artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurring masking a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, unsharp masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider sets the blurring of the area of the ink to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink tints allow a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be preserved in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film grading or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value fittingly to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be placed higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is traversed. normally here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-step-wide since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the term. therefore, we recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons Save as and Load make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file, and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="529">"below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefact in the foreground, that caused by a poor film shift during the journey."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindows advanced settings can remain in the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the field of sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if it is elevated, you may need to re-adjust the edges -filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive Filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all the noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically stronger.</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter cushioning. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering range responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and store: these buttons are used for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have placed can be stored in the file system and then loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to sharpen an image. use this tool to soften the soft sign with the menu item Correcting softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by setting the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as there is otherwise blurred effects caused by motion."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's film and colour or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation with a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker's copyright."</seg>

<seg id="593">"since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, since the color combinations are missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>

<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images of their gradients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob picks the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="620">Schüttelevsharpenfe: blurred the image by random shifting of pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the colour basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>

<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. it gives natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face which should stay free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>

<seg id="629">"photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools, in order to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality."</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>

<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be placed higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the buttons" "Save as" "and" "loading" "are used for this purpose. any stallying for photo can be saved as a text file and later recharged."</seg>

<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply clicking with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the entries File Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of height and width is always assigned to the width."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. you can, for example, see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog, you can use the Max. Relation button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the help make it possible to fade in aid, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonious Triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-thirds, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden centre: the gold center is a division based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational figure 1,618033988... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the gold center. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquefied corps when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third-party rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral, creating a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye falls into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points on the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not triangular triangles. diagonals to place these lines can make a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"when you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options are mirrored and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, then it happens easily that you don't hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window.</seg>

<seg id="667">"the Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after turning, but keep in mind the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are carried out at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:"</seg>

<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes a little smeared. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformers cutting off the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal setting, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left."</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option is whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information from your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your images frequently, or later use them in other ways, you should not select the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG image in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and finish. in the following, each area is described more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="919">"first, enter the title of the moment and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages, you see an example of these settings."</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page."</seg>
<seg id="921">"last but not least, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this way, you can avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. therefore, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section, you can define how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this way, those who look at your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download images that for example have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time that you have set. so, it can search your images with low resolution, which results in a smaller transfer time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best, choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select a folder or protocol supported by KDE, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"once you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages are created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files created by you still are not in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, properly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings you have just described have all been related to base folders or URLs. in these settings, a subfolder will be created whose name you specify in output folders."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with these."</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage to save all images into the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can either export a .kim file either directly from the File Export... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access through the File Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">"at option Manual, copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically button to copy near the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">".kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the option Export file."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option on this page is to limit the maximum picture size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu item... select, it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories will be imported to the imported file, and which categories will match them in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database. an example of this can be seen in the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you see pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured."</seg>

<seg id="960">"the applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum are not working. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications attach their pictures into albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order after albums for some modules to make you use the functions with & kphotoalbum."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; add titles to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, upload the information, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (referring to the translator: this is meant by the author) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being harmed by the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than those used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has verified the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"a visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this hasn't happened yet."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the recorded WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution concerned, before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a coding, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flc & etc;) might be installed."</seg>

<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"the first section deals with the basic setting of & kaudiocreator;, something that will probably only be done once and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes the procedure to read a & CD, which needs to be repeated for each CD."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with which freedb to use the & CD; download data from the internet."</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it every time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>

<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each tone represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the pitch means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>

<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>

<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; the best way is to use the toolbar menu. use and adding are different. adding tool bars is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"the toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars or toolbars can be executed, which can be indicated in the dialog where actions on this or other tool bar are to be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"by calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory."</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set Settings Activities.</seg>
<seg id="2197">"templates are basically complete document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree."</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more specialized documents are nested in corresponding subfolders."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"this type of template is useful, if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can contain everything from a comment on a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see for more information about the template tree."</seg>
<seg id="2202">"they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2203">"create a document structure as you want (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;), and select File As Template as a local template...."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"as soon as this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"select text in your document and click File As template saving selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"the creation of binary templates is simple: copying the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop or paste over the account tree of Konqueror."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"you can click on a folder on the right and choose site template to enter and back a name for the template. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each folder is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to set a folder's behavior, right-click on the folder and select Properties from the Properties menu. the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2211">"a selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates."</seg>
<seg id="2212">"if a root folder is so set, it would disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably will find yourself in a root folder."</seg>
<seg id="2213">"allows leading or downstream text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project, allowing by copying content templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"in addition, you have a context menu (pointing right mouse button) using a complete command file for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another."</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & source text editor which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back to source editor, where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor in sync."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and source editor can be adjusted via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast machines and a large span for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"the document properties dialog is also called upon when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this allows the reduction of the manual coding. thus, you can change the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2221">"meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click into the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column."</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"it is possible to use the cursor as in text processing, moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strangely. text can be inserted by typing and by using back button or removed button."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"inserting tags will be done in the same way over the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags before already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other tag anchor must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the table wizard or the Listen wizard are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; they will need to be used in this release to use the tables or lists toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later any number of additional useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting output. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the merge-merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and follow the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">"the Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the Compare and merge of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field for target is active and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop-down: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"if you want to find out how much these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, then upload them to & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can easily copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, you can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's in the next section (merging) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file does not have rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with a broken line."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparison windows) has also an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [Gemodify] if you edited the result. usually it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Springe to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two compare windows are used, each difference is simultaneously a conflict which needs to be solved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes by automatic merging, or by manual editing, there is no more line left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no row in the list. this is only a placeholder for the event that you may change your mind and perhaps yet another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a selection that you may copy and paste somewhere else."</seg>

<seg id="2316">"in the output window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image Up / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict."</seg>

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it for themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are perfectly sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessor command for pointers. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>

<seg id="2511">"first, you should be aware of which places a mouse click will remain without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window, which does not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"when your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you clean not only the mouse sphere, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse sphere."</seg>

<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place."</seg>
<seg id="2519">"solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. however, you can park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. safe zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows."</seg>

<seg id="2522">"do not use the smart shift if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while holding the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again."</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"moreover, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions are provided to easily filter and sort the log lines of a log file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after startup, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. if you do not see this, and it opens itself instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteria or after entered strings. in addition, enter a string in the filter bar. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter contains the entry All. then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"of course, you can also select another entry. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. in addition, in the protocol file system protocol, select the name of a process, so show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a conspicuous color as log lines of level indicator. the color representation of protocol rows can be turned off set-up dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can check the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the Add to new lines to be enabled in the main window contextual menu to display all new additions to the protocol."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, earlier known (and so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when starting the system in the & Linux world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not deal with historical aspects here (among others because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important, because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without creating a reinstallation and re-formatting. this is why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to run when starting the system or switching to another running level. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be located in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial to / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program init at various points and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default level 3 is 3. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have done something, then come repair by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original running level (or its position). this only happens when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them to a new level. to copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another running level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the product number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are extracted from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard levels, and now the machine starts constantly anew. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under running level X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services in these distributions are started simplifies configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that it can be added to this manual."</seg>

<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry Save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space constraints (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings."</seg>
