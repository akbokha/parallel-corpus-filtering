&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; he never thinks behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican elections was the highest figure ever reached by the party nom@@ ini@@ zed candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Program , which welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; along with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; tr@@ umps did not agree . &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met in our joint love for basketball , and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also contrary to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump was making his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave presi@@ dency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; assign@@ ing people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think differently .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Ed . Ü ) : as much as &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; the pu@@ n from white to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones called , has exactly killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump there is , however , a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now tr@@ umps land , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish

what did the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
&quot; but this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered youth such a rare hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ arranged instruments made from local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made from tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
&quot; that changed when Fa@@ vio had been shown something , which he had never seen before : a violin made of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic tr@@ ash pon@@ y ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est , as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even performed his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offen@@ se of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia for pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries in 2012 founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which then had driven the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and support each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to trace . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the s@@ nail @-@ emp@@ o that circul@@ ated information between individual countries , the actions happen in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activity or details that have been noticed or experienced during port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to design@@ ate ships that go fishing in prohibited areas , such as those who point out suspi@@ cious routes - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lost each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; its practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of fantasy seeds , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; You may not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
the closed front has been working so far .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspi@@ cious vessels . &quot;
criminal networks discovered that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escape ships .
&quot; due to its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal Shi@@ ps who like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find discrimin@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence this un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Conservation Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each individual track@@ able vessel worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; getting together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources to investigate . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that had been f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now account for 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fishing boats have bought more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the impact is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first great triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag , was not only on the way without a license and used tow@@ ing networks , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative working approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is spreading further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot; &quot;
road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s application for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including Bar@@ inas in the Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a low@@ lands , in the central North @-@ lying federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the mandate of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ working at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision in its latest article as follows : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , the demonstr@@ ators urged to continue on 27 October a mass rally organised by representatives of the opposition . in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the afternoon as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , should continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;

&quot; on Twitter images that tell of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round that forms the scale of repression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s for this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your inc@@ eption !
on the road !
&quot; others regard these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis , and prefers to hide critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis was not a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him K@@ ent .
I told my father about him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass just that she will not kid@@ nap you one day and I have to rescue you .
&quot; for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the abbrevi@@ ation ERP represents the military arm of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers Party . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be a secret agent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I entered in , and saw a couch , which men were tortured . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached that to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was tied just there .
&quot; she rarely bin@@ ds a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there in it was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ dy .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to the eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - they were all tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people were sitting still on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you kill me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was aware that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms called offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero sum@@ med up a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to information from survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of death in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ zi@@ as , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ v@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be la@@ yed . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military later , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yields are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one has fought against an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but when one goes into a house and the refrigerator , record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you , who are driving cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with rage , hit me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; to this end , we don &apos;t need anyone else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the Defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went as far to say :
&quot; well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
she was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
&quot; I repeatedly asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have been put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom they could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act that one can do to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ established , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but there is always something left .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought of showing my father was during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I told him about all the atro@@ cities I had to experience with him because of all the atro@@ cities I had .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they claimed to be defending , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Well , tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I issued the first ad . &quot;
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me that I &apos;m pre@@ occupied . I finally declared against my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 , still under house arrest before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a under 10 year old child . &quot;

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 , committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court sentenced life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ itance : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ state terrorism &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on fair@@ ness for the victims . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there was a memorial to be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; in Kyoto . &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driving licence . &quot;
the photograph was spread in the social media .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a very particularly failed translation last month . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; on a sign , wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malign@@ ant rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ect ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the excuse :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( translation ) , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a little more in detail with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country , however , is quite a reason for concern . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by senior citizens in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens made 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by senior citizens has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the article published on Yahoo , the un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly raise against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on the translation error on Yahoo , among others , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and use active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which may produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have foreign employees do not allow translations to be produced internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the en@@ acted and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions , which arise through machine translations , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zzling prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless to jewellery . but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards one can expect more careful translations .
&quot; in the future , Kyoto &apos;s city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; also other online tran@@ smit@@ ters carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which resist@@ ed the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was z@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ ker : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again closed .
this is from @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission considered it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national television channels .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ ly later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies or refuses to respond to such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday , April 6 , when V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mean , just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with her family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as a cri@@ cket for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their minor son or her minor daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof above the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that children have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; the practice described as Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the Cri@@ mean is generally not silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that welcomes the girl with her and whose exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent strikes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with just 3000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra arrived with a stick on Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply involved in the practice of Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; says T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ breaking - if the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ay@@ an a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all , and began selling sweets on the street or market in order to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn . &quot;
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the master of the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone to listen while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , they declared . &quot;
&quot; it was , however , perfectly clear that she had paid her hard work for everything she got from them . &quot;
&quot; in the school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ings exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ cket . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to us .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot;
then the author of the ad cre@@ pt again once more :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write once again , if something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue of the report Cri@@ mean tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ bo@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ mean tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies by former Cri@@ mean tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í had to pay tribute to them , and the native population was forced to embar@@ k on a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted in favour of a draft law on &quot; the regulations of use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if accepted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up which is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to issue social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video coaching and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , parliamentary deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocked by Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level on Facebook . as a result , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techni@@ cian ( Senior Research Techni@@ cian ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they are forci@@ bly physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , this means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot;
&quot; technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no diver@@ gent nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against Cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; To@@ dd Reu@@ bold &apos;s contribution was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal welfare campaig@@ ner H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards fighting through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and growth of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a qualified bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a enjoys a passion for another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to setting up protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for North East Japan , documented the progress that was achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture has been an official pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate have been evacu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has yet witnessed a nuclear accident , and alone 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local perspective what progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the jap@@ an@@ ese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( the &quot; &quot; Er@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated shel@@ ters from shel@@ ters ( &quot; &quot; to cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) will be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the disaster was settled in final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned .
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have been affected extensively . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural lands , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent on the same level , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the population lives , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed found that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention was done . &quot;
how it is for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ated refugees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people were reloc@@ ated back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 state , 40,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated refugees who still live in shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger at first than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa tells about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march across the country . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the polic@@ eman &apos;s face is to be seen , who attacked a head@@ stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ per@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards ha@@ sten to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in the social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10.000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the costs for medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .
from : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . release with permission .
&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police ass@@ aults
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday there were brutal police deplo@@ y@@ ments against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media has covered road protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported about a broken glass window , in order to be illustr@@ atively illustr@@ ative of their title pages with a photo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ known Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were la@@ under@@ ed .
&quot; after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long period of in@@ active time are in operation because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembered to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a subject for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became intol@@ erable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , sugar prices rose about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations agricultural and food organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry started . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar@@ cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of appari@@ tion , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; everyone was signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over@@ written and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that had been harvested in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work lan@@ der has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for closing the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the popular congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to measure it , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they became replacement parts .
&quot; without a prospect of the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production is not even intended for the supply of the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ nine ti@@ thes bring a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to the old soldier , to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes back 65 years in retirement , not because it lacks strength , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops are bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e communities in North Que@@ bec and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop encourages young participants to talk about topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the trunk of the Kit@@ hum@@ kal First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages , although young people do not always speak the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is at your disposal , as is a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody would be interested in me
but I keep trying to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; this way , they can grow and also lead our youth forward &quot;
&quot; in this way , they can do what they intended for the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary piece , the reader and advocate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ ma@@ u ( see the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ osk district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies , who produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ e . &quot;
now in special sales : new plastic dishes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food products is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
we also produced this part of the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there anyone who would say , &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , in order to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more quir@@ ky plastic dishes , you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # &quot; s , &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which de@@ votes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of national and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regul@@ ars regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the report on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the s@@ ine cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse lies behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co sum@@ mon@@ ed the digital project &quot; &quot; Le@@ ak a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by traffi@@ ckers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; like fear life &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who only one day lost her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have asked to go and to search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; my mother , too , is here with me too . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the hop@@ el@@ essness of man is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being &quot; so@@ aked . &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was rob@@ bed with threats . &quot; &quot;
you are thinking of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for they do not know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence , and he had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which he is linked include pictures where violence is represented .
the check @-@ out is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a horri@@ fic accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions to our desire for images to messages . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place S@@ ange in the East of the Democratic Republic of Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected and destroyed . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , he fell victim to that of the tank truck . &quot;
&quot; representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , covering dozens of houses including a cinema nearby which was full of people who watched the World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al pictures of the incident make up the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it displays rows of char@@ ted bodies that are lined up on the floor while persons are watching them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and in@@ correctly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one was left behind to count bodies , &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
&quot; the event for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; indeed , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example mistakenly deleted the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who could flee were pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being said , monks and politicians would have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source , too , wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an inver@@ ted picture search , you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the reported picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mask of private sites , social media platforms and communal and national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed false reports and some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; we have set up examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also linked in some cases ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of fake coupl@@ ings from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ts or false noti@@ fications .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples , which according to the metadata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also show for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only ren@@ ames the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the picture from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; Nigeria &apos;s est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in Northern Canada in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; we have clearly not seen pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ sters which refu@@ te this . &quot;

this page used the image as evidence for Muslims to kill Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this claim was re@@ fut@@ ed by a gre@@ ek fac@@ ten@@ check page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
an association of students of theology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
a resident of the old part of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this message to his side in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s bom@@ b@@ ings in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the picture from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ gh@@ ten the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has published a judi@@ ci@@ ary on what it referred to as &quot; deliberately shel@@ tered news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this amend@@ ment , which was exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of report kitchens that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
Russia , 2012 . &quot; vulner@@ ability of a bu@@ limi@@ a ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this message fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 admitted that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still included in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am published by An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , the Catholic close to the Catholic Church , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; &quot; similar &quot; &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
&quot; when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dunk@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo ended with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and spark@@ ed a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this were translated into Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to ho@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) are also indic@@ ative : the Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence associated with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ intentionally participate in tear@@ ing the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
&quot; the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here , for example ) . &quot;
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the worry that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and giving them the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to be discussed about violent demonstrations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be replaced by context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. inv@@ inci@@ ble ) stri@@ ves to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or at all not to be translated . &quot;
these words are written in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ inci@@ ble words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ á ) .
but they all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; the blog contains , for example , words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s VAT @-@ cla@@ p language , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - Bem@@ ite you about your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ kill@@ .com language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after freezing cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; &quot; inv@@ alu@@ able &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; or@@ ators of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Cal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ al Centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missing for the floods and mud wave sw@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places of stay . &quot;
&quot; rainf@@ all took place on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ o@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already underway . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water cone of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five were completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for anyone who wants to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster center is informed .
&quot; last year after the cat@@ astro@@ phy of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; key that allowed users to access a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations , and these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in security and provide aid measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now on the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims who cannot be seen
&quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21st , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we channels rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the i@@ con@@ ian image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound by an American flag , other gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , aren &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they are ab@@ domin@@ ating me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , will be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
to be m@@ isi@@ fied
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
this is even happening to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western sense , the religion of Rum@@ i was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid put the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians and the news industry and Hollywood continue to for@@ ge them .
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA could not even vote for their first female presidential candidates . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and forced Saudi Arabian women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong fol@@ ly weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken by Afri@@ cans that were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and err@@ ingly , that often Si@@ kh @-@ males and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create s@@ cars that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , originating from 77 countries . &quot;

use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now an ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m kid@@ ding , we don &apos;t wear all the cock@@ ro@@ aches with us . &quot;
we also need to be not the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widely spread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islamic hos@@ tility machinery with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ scar@@ f to a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our belonging .
&quot; it takes up our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it is impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 feet concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms , and whis@@ per her the Arabic scriptures to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim adher@@ ence is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an ic@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging is my mat@@ ernal grandmother &apos;s image with her sisters , as they were able to win a competition in the art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi a few decades ago . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who , for centuries , have been col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company has established with the name Ven@@ erable British East Line Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging is to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was dis@@ car@@ ded before a century ago on a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ a sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops scattered over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy hits the US and bears susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ess , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple ties , but fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion hides more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals can build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this question . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and were extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders on people from just the countries that bomb it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly List &quot; that is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs , which we reject in Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically impro@@ per@@ ly picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression that we fail in our news au@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims inside the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
Col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are in .
and that moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , she had not yet given her ; now , they master large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but today I have made me an inevitable Muslim . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the interactions that make up our humanity , a story may be l@@ ur@@ king where someone is made to &quot; another . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination four decades ago science of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions on the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
&quot; for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies : &quot;
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening to it often involves understanding , &quot; these events instead &quot; can &quot; listen to , feel , touch . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even though the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience can be contacted . &quot;
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ hin@@ ara tells the story of the rab@@ bits and the vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ ug@@ ula is asked : &quot; &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness with a wide gr@@ in : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events held by Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organizers hope to extend this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for US re@@ establishment of sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 . the march launched at the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Ne@@ ural Testing of Deb@@ ts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Church meeting of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishment of debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico call for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed salary corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deter@@ red by falling pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art sovereign territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and convic@@ tions of the citizens , the measures imposed on the outside will be at risk of being rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ Sp@@ ell campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which has been published last year and is available free of charge , contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it reads : &quot;
&quot; this book seeks to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what is the true cost associated with this . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the ne@@ bul@@ a that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the A@@ dra @-@ prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Germany , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ vision@@ ally than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would do all about this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this stri@@ pe in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in custody .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak good English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other deta@@ inees to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a rehear@@ sal that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book@@ case of Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes bid farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el incar@@ cer@@ ation , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
&quot; according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention by 2016 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
&quot; Mozambique : post @-@ release corruption , convic@@ ted of corruption , back on previous post &quot;
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on the corruption of corruption in which a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his prison sentence , in which corruption was perpet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for disp@@ ers@@ al of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( some 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from the public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for its res@@ etting to the company , which took place on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who evaluated the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to re@@ pay his old post because the company did not carry any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many residents do not welcome the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the offen@@ ders .
&quot; the company apparently remained silent , however , and did not cause appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would have been advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it . &quot;
&quot; he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not possess any moral : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already hurt the state so massi@@ vely .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the morality to return and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself on the state . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre @-@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; it prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind him that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he stren@@ u@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not like that . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was over 10 years old and was released . &quot;
&quot; # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - May 12 , 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to German : @ Truth ) states that crimin@@ ality is paying off in Mozambique :

Facebook blocks rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ inters .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dero@@ g@@ atory con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , were cens@@ ored in order to express their use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play of words . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ats believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it destro@@ ys all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ t@@ hook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive quite a good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy does not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I prohibited the li@@ king , posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; was not consistent with the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post states &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to increase the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to take control of the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look around in context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the to@@ dd@@ lers
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the law , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements ende@@ avor@@ ing to abol@@ ish laws for child marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; however , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du Leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of child@@ birth , they should , dar@@ n &apos;t worry about their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained herself , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook that Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Bill Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at was elected in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one on the other . &quot;
&quot; after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws were finally changed to children &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Lov@@ ell Francis , a member of the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that we@@ ars the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was of the opinion that it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot;
the law has been approved .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of adop@@ ting the law , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for am@@ ending the legislation was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted in favour of the law .
the to@@ e is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ sp@@ ag@@ ei@@ s@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who fought against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed and he seems to be releasing his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject otherwise . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; rather , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , we would simply speak of the problem that the state , which protects our daughters from being ab@@ used against them , would then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world in which children &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit . &quot;
h@@ acker ste@@ ers the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in front of national protests on the Russian national day
screen printing of the message posted on Sunday early on the Public Prosecutor &apos;s website of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l Municip@@ ality .
&quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s Day - Russian National Day , the website of the Prosecutor of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was hack@@ ed . &quot;
or we bring you into the jail instead of Dim@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the hack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is not Dim@@ on for you &quot; &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office calls on citizens to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the page - however , it remained in the cache . &quot;
it &apos;s # gentle gone
&quot; on Sunday morning , the office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia Content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright legislation in the USA . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series revol@@ ve against the blocking .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now sub@@ merged . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform transferred all Turkish Wikipedia sites to its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is available in spite of the legal ban . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the ban on Wikipedia ) , we set out to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
&quot; a su@@ h@@ len@@ se N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colors .
that motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take pictures that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helped him with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild animal photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) inv@@ oked me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he was to know &#91; it &#93; , for he had already seen tig@@ ers face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late at night . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ har@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we looked at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit : I click on environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
&quot; his passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wildlife , however , is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband and fear the consequences should they dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do court and expelled from her family and village community after having appe@@ aled to a married relative with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of not nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and manages this club . &quot;
she reports how this club has created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open a conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify .
&quot; not to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly is a custom , which they all uph@@ old and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini points out :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
&quot; in the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise she just sat down in front of herself ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put on the women &apos;s head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another member of the club decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if he did . &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion during each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have never talked so frank@@ ly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only supported Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them are okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ em @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the mer@@ its of the choice of clothing , the moral connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini ornam@@ ented her own pair of kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) in a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it . &quot;
&quot; to the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are coming slowly : &quot;
so far we have only made small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then again listening to the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about , and what we do . &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .

screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29th this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag on the Japanese Twitter trend was to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here have become quite quickly aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day in Japan . &quot;
&quot; still today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies use the fan base in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; today , I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
that is how the day will go today .
&quot; so , we hope you are here ! &quot;

bald @-@ headed men are de@@ ported and killed in Mozambique
Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia &apos;s police warned the population that men of bald men could be attacked in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald persons for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , dis@@ regards the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently made use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man can reveal gold or bring wealth , said the police officer at Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in South Africa conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men traveling to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ deca@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably dissip@@ ative rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this attracts the police of the Republic of Mozambique . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ na@@ ï@@ a who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , DAS S@@ ICH en@@ capsul@@ ates a country in which people would have shame to go to the streets as if they would be ashamed of taking photos of a por@@ no@@ film in which the teachers would be ashamed to earn their bread , a country in which people would rever@@ t honest pursu@@ its or even take their lives to get their bread . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humour could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ deca@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both plain @-@ faced : &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt sympathy to his family , friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding the public access to the Internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; until today , Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work is a pioneer of the Open Web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have been put to death in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made just recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized because of liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( sovereign risk ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokesman says that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , China will continue to get calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to release his or her treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed until December last year . Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume exports to China , as the exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the EU &apos;s leading diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us to release Li@@ us as she announced on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; us Ambassador to Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad granted that the Americans &quot; wish him the possibility of treating abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; announ@@ cing a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the news agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the embassy was asking the Chinese authorities to release Li@@ u not only Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which she claims according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7th and 8th July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg , Germany . &quot;
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing , the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns about whether the fuss around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us Law@@ yer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot;

&quot; on 29 June , China urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; on June 27 , the Council of land@@ ings in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance for those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature of Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 , around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished had led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; personally I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that is , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercising of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice , to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ encour@@ agement were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of which he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re returns from author@@ itarian rulers who preten@@ ded to be Democrats , abandoned the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ rep@@ lies to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system . &quot;
he did not respond to such questions with rational methods .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high enough to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the full board of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this correctly and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are viewed as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink personnel cut@@ out ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade , tends to be a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors uncovered about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in anger when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all loved Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand , ... . &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago , before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; very often . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , if one would conf@@ use me for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward in fact . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
to be harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and don &apos;t deserve to pay attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main characteristic of the Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band celebrated in Thailand published a music video , which par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what regulations his girlfriend does .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists warned the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; alter@@ ation &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered by the jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also set up , which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand continues a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Dis@@ charge ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
the Life goes on to the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was published first on the website of OC Media and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East @-@ West @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together on Soviet pages in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
&quot; the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
it is nevertheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ kas , which are still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply prohibited us , it &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when vac@@ ations are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , it reminds of the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just removed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation turns to the end , a little boy is running over us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a ruined building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases after him .

a group of children are now pursuing the ball .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is run by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ que and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Afrika . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2,@@ 50 the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full b@@ ans and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Afrika ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some even have slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister hoping to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Afrika . &quot; Mama Afrika is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Afrika since months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they went away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he escaped with his wife and three children from people who wanted to press money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the ais@@ les , the travellers calm@@ ly consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves with numerous photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair care , she has made her a kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she imag@@ ines her .
&quot; Ya I fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;

&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the Communication , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police report that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic Web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme t@@ ass@@ ures and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; images from mainland China &quot; ) , cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos of a check@@ point in which police officers checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ an make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without this software , they may be deta@@ ined up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Mao &apos;s China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( in addition to a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council of the City to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office at the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police station . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible violations , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : all cries for death &quot;
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and make sure you are alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes all honour to her name .
one who has settled down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality catches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is spinning on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone have been erected . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the leader of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were ri@@ pped during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods sought , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city , which is plu@@ gged into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat , after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped working . &quot;
I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice contra@@ sted by silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment , you realize that you are liber@@ ating the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Council . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel , Gh@@ ass@@ an , stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only courageous enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot;
his eyes filled with water .
&quot; and you are really sorry to see me in my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my cause when I replied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells . &quot;
I take a look at all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and can immediately set me up without waiting for her permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I resor@@ ted to an old tried and tested method of communication : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; first @-@ han@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness there are no visible facial features to me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers deny their existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would let him go if I stay .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive out all these crow@@ s , which refresh themselves in the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries are heard , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Schwarz was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which presented us horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; this revealed the secret : to protect state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played out their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that follow him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest demonstrations that will soon end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t fail him enough , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator used to work as a tr@@ ash collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , in order to present the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view . &quot;
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still on the line .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped shou@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it , which is why he acted as the next to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to store my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens , and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fu@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry about terrible troubles . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photograph was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he slides to his screen , sometimes to his computer , to his couch again and again . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the top@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ lows ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with issues like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that go from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version to the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed from the second generation , &quot; he describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he poured into water dissolved Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot jun@@ cture has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the mu@@ zzle of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled the performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert had &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which is the ancient legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement might not simply be mere rhet@@ oric , but rather reflect an ever more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ patri@@ ated traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently lowered unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women , who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past years , the number of &quot; &quot; honour kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be deta@@ ined in@@ definitely in prison &quot; , &quot; and their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; also , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that long as t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , not politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was in@@ tim@@ ated to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is attacking the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in essence can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse repe@@ ats conspic@@ u@@ ously : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan about gay rights and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his commentary was torn from the context , twisted and his opinion cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly advoc@@ ates the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and thinks that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems today . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ is , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic realm , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices would be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service had established several former government decre@@ es and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the ration@@ ale that they had critical comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is continuous giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially created demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and resist@@ s resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great extravag@@ ant war pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ e@@ ders , drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the west mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two for@@ lor@@ ries are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a height of 18 metres was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outside appearance and body care were so important as in this story , as they help to keep Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has resulted in getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ paralleled demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts compete against each other in order to show who one of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and receive training in hair@@ dresser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , as we have built up this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel expelled , accommod@@ ating affection ? &quot;
&quot; precisely this question left the two young Colom@@ bian milit@@ ants Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , inspired by the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la V@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters . &quot;
&quot; after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the sign of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of a genuine reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried arms around the clock , must now re@@ integrate into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take up these ranks and support them in setting up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that young Colom@@ bians could join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
&quot; the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , to be handed over personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more urgently . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed urgent attention . &quot;
&quot; the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN stores in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done before to counter the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support for people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ worker of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a sort of cottage where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because beside him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful to me , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; and I embra@@ ced him , and sat down beside the gar@@ net . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , it was a pity to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there who wa@@ its for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have learned only how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; to the start , students and some of the leaders of the F@@ ARC met for a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have witnessed how the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and hated even humans with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all men , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something , and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; according to the Colom@@ bian people , peace would reign after dis@@ armament . &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to weapons , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology belong to them - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ a sum@@ ova , and its first release on the website OC Media . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ osexual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat posed by the LG@@ BT@@ Q community at the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community did not come into being overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
&quot; several months ago , the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines once reports have been published that address the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who took suspi@@ cious que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch had experienced the gender equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the last analysis . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot;
after that the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day .
apparently some women had taken everything and started shou@@ ting .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung wing . &quot;
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in the men &apos;s or the women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for having treated respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad things , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was wrong . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering me , without ID , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you are safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; we don &apos;t talk about the gender balance , however , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really bother to look like the person she reminds of her past - so to my male shape . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : last week , I filed a report in Washington . &quot;
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not finish a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end ask for proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has undergone grati@@ fication through blood . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still deta@@ ined in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine tells me , there would be no very many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are deta@@ ined there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to become radi@@ cal@@ ised . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ards had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think that already before 2003 , I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
seriously !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : what is possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never even bent me on a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t know about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
people often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but above all about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it was possible to sense how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; those who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic ever worsen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activities are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ et@@ ra@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it for a long time .
&quot; I discovered these people myself , when I cli@@ cked off places of refuge . &quot;
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay ones . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an have what , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have what , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of a transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , in order to be precise , different settings of life . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all because I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i , on August 27 , drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , such as Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which much of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran is located , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy acquired power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most productive and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime den@@ ies Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a wide range of dam@@ s to transfer water from the Arab areas to the Persian territory , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , graduated from 55 % a secondary school and graduated with 45 % of university degrees . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , human rights activ@@ ist activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , including inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot;

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the statement , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women - who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even lay well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists . &quot;
&quot; for example , women earn less money nowadays despite the same education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is known to me and known .
I am convinced and I am suffering twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on black women , on black women women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , emotion@@ ally and verb@@ ally , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to &quot; sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alized violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are facing black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her thinking , which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I too refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is in historical terms a fragmented and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to promote their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to close white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and sex , because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women different origin a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than engaging me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever to define black women for our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book &quot; &quot; Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ an@@ ismus &quot; &quot; ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has neither crossed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; To@@ dd Reu@@ bold &apos;s contribution was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that is particularly concerned about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past seven years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a re@@ counts . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia von E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is based on neglected , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative Vide@@ ographie and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed churches that can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # har@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the people concerned .
&quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman appeared Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , also A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez reported nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back to her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women at all reimbur@@ se ad , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not imply endor@@ sement of Paragu@@ ay@@ ans : good approach , inadequate implementation pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ gy@@ ms , a socio @-@ scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are several indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were given to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the police came from women .
&quot; there were over 5,000 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of the women &apos;s advertisements came here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot;
&quot; there are two women who don &apos;t do this , &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the mental violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they let themselves be fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told him how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users sur@@ vey@@ ed Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , strug@@ gled for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victim of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ as case , everything started with psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ay@@ an law : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good but cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # 1 ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ nen@@ macher ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal offen@@ se and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the bill was changed in a number of ways in order to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill envis@@ aged that most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they simply restore an adver@@ t and wish to obtain safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as a part of inter @-@ human relations . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence can no longer be seen as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the crime of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
we must report for such a long time until abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been altered , among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation . &quot;
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after b@@ anning a newspaper continues to stop attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking paper Az@@ am@@ n for reporting corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he has served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the single sul@@ tan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , limiting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and incar@@ cer@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the authorities reduce peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after the paper published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the Court of Justice of the Supreme Court in Oman to put a ruling on an inheritance dispute . &quot;
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the head@@ line : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the board of editorial board , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was appointed editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who headed for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as editor @-@ in @-@ chief . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper in any way , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the trial in Mas@@ kat the first trial took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining the State of the State . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail of 5000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the appeals court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he has served his one @-@ year sentence .
&quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to resume Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Korean government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Security signed a further instruction in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to permit the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated recently in Oman .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Korean authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive infrin@@ gement of freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to meet peac@@ efully , and provide protection to them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Germany &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , and is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent . &quot;
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of global healthcare .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by drug companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research conducted by African scientists will help to build up own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) , Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself was investigating the HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a mo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is demand for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; the system , that magazines can only make available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how open source seed producers change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s contribution was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work has been limited by his own imagination and the question of how many types of salad he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security ensure food safety is the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but he now needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river to add@@ ling .
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , he is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tubes of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

&quot; it is not by chance that this name sounds like this , as if the movement originated from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the free open source software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed that they bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy seeds , cross it to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , check on seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important to food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds play a role in greater cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , &quot; &quot; he says , and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are being offered on farmers markets , as it should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to patents on seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; such estimates do not yet exist for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by assume that large @-@ scale cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Mat@@ ter of Visi@@ bility
&quot; plants are bred so that they have specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property classi@@ fies other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not prevent innovation , but it promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to facilitate farmers their work .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are needed masses of her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; for 20 years I have been protected against competition with a patent , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be leading the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , implements a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also helps them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open source license , which is ultimately a form@@ less and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; a statement , however , is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to find out about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for the next year &apos;s official launch . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - published a report . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seeds , exchange it and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how things are grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports it above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains abi@@ ding despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Canada &apos;s blog is given a home , is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video of how the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the government and reflected what this meant for him : &quot;
&quot; the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege , an arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; now , however , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also documented the blocking of vendors , through which internet cens@@ orship and private surfing were possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; in addition , the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these actions in court . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day , newspapers are reporting in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; On the second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe coo@@ ks pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air travel to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published on 16 August the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new category called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex offen@@ se , etc . , but what happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world , with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions to cover up . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not civilians but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argue against den@@ ying violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of the public service . &quot;
&quot; in memory , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is said to be &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015 . &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the rates of murder per state , Rio is in number 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is extra part of Glob@@ o &apos;s largest media company , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has reiter@@ ated the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; one of these security policy measures was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease in violent death cases . but for some years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor municipalities that should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an in@@ significant point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week later , the police took the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime vis @-@ à @-@ vis loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute , The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 urged the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the United Nations investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been under siege from rebel areas outside of Damascus , which led to the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smu@@ g@@ gled foods . &quot;
&quot; through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ essi@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been campaig@@ ning for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ essi@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of about € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions &quot; &quot; before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese call for justice for the fire victims of 2017
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the northern part of Portugal during the week . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days .
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery alone in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ mia - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why the Civil Defence was unable to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as much as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did not do this anywhere , there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the form of forest , which the government had made after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced an e@@ asing of the law , which permitted construction activity to be avoided if the applicant had the means of self @-@ defence - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val writes in the same article of P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from easily combus@@ tible wood could spread , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of Civil Defence of Portugal took place on 15 and 16 October when residents were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided information for the population : it converted its own civil protection data through the application fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade , and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million requests . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in G@@ haz@@ ni Province for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say that at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ le party , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hate came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found herself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than themselves , in order to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy two times a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high ratings , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ trained personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum , which can be deduc@@ ted for months after the asylum application has been registered . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible way of living helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af plu@@ cked all his savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Lux@@ ury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian lux@@ uries - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade , and go back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces in the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn about packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; citizen &apos;s report : bills of law from Egypt enable de@@ activation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority .
&quot; users would have to register to use social networks within six months of successful legal submission to the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identity number . &quot;
those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the du@@ sting of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , applied by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for insul@@ ting the president or high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , such a deed would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , according to the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the de@@ priv@@ ation of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan also threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , bog@@ us exposure from among others weapons of arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for reporting the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists on scre@@ ened documents
&quot; in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial draft bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali who accused corruption of all illeg@@ ally received funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the Tunis County Court on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks should be achieved by eliminating anonymous comments . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only selective enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as an &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government is conducting a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and force them upon request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ str@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English articles , the information that Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was closed because it &quot; &quot; a source of information &quot; &quot; collabor@@ ates with groups in order to send a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
&quot; after this week &apos;s review , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time , and install Backdoor programs , de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
