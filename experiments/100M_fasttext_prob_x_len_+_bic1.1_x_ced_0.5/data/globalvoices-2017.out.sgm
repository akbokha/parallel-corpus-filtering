<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man," "I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never thinks behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest figure ever reached by the party nominized candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Program, which welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"along with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "trumps did not agree."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met in our joint love for basketball, and we spent many hours watching the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps intolerance is also contrary to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leaks, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump was making his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave presidency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"assigning people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Ed. Ü): as much as" rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities, "the pun from white to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones called, has exactly killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trump there is, however, a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried, and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO."</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now trumps land, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca have in common with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a few years now, La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered youth such a rare hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with rearranged instruments made from local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made from trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"that changed when Favio had been shown something, which he had never seen before: a violin made of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic trash pony) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest, as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational play of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offense of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "all of a sudden, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia for pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries in 2012 founded by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which then had driven the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and support each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to trace. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail-empo that circulated information between individual countries, the actions happen in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activity or details that have been noticed or experienced during port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also attentively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible for the authorities to designate ships that go fishing in prohibited areas, such as those who point out suspicious routes - such as those suggesting that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lost each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"its practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasy seeds, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-fully organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "You may not run my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been working so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">Criminal networks discovered that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escape ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal Ships who like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps build a system that combines different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find discriminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence this unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Conservation Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each individual trackable vessel worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "getting together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources to investigate."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now account for 33% increase in fishery sales since fishing boats have bought more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets where they were forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the impact is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "With security the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first great triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag, was not only on the way without a license and used towing networks, which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative working approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I thought it was fine."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>

<seg id="208">"at that time I was not able to realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis was not a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Perla prison."</seg>

<seg id="224">"he told me, I would be a secret agent."</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">"at the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner."</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">"the prisoners are tortured,"</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I entered in, and saw a couch, which men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached that to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person that was tied just there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"she rarely binds a person with handcuffs to the bed, overthrew him with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there in it was horrific... like a dirty windy.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and were tied to the eye."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian also accused of trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - they were all tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people were sitting still on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you kill me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I was aware that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, there were some rooms called offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero summed up a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"(according to information from survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also accused of death in La Perla-Ribera's trial, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina)."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video Emilio Feszias, head of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came here is also the way on which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">"here their names were changed, and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuvra until the order from above came that they should be layed."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war yields are a bayonet or perhaps military signs that one has fought against an enemy that one has fought."</seg>

<seg id="273">"but when one goes into a house and the refrigerator, record player, clothing, painting, money... steals, then this is not a war yield but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could participate in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal and I replied," "And you, who are driving cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with rage, hit me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">"to this end, we don't need anyone else!"</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of then, on which I wore a jacket and a pullover of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the Defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay me a burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last disgusting act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now that I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you realize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went as far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, so you executed people during the dictatorship, but why would the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">"I repeatedly asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have been put in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom they could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last disgusting act that one can do to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when the democracy was re-established, they fetched machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." you will never find anything, "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But there is always something left.</seg>
<seg id="307">I've seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of showing my father was during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I told him about all the atrocities I had to experience with him because of all the atrocities I had.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked me why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they claimed to be defending, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>

<seg id="317">I've seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate.</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving licence, witnessed a very particularly failed translation last month."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the Japanese word" "older motorists" "means" "older motorists" "on a sign, wrongly - but perhaps also with malignant rear-thoughts & # 8212; as" "terrible motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">"edited by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable", "Holmes said."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was initially removed. the name" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct designation" "elder drivers" "(German:" "older drivers" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefect apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that older people felt offended by insufficient correction (translation)," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed a little more in detail with the phenomenon of "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country, however, is quite a reason for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"for example, in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 deaths were caused by senior citizens in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens made 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by senior citizens has risen in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"in the article published on Yahoo, the unnamed reporter brought comments to the light that show what prejudices some Japanese seemingly raise against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on the translation error on Yahoo, among others, received the following comments:"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and use active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which may produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-searching, or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have foreign employees do not allow translations to be produced internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the enacted and enigmatic propositions, which arise through machine translations, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless to jewellery. but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards one can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, Kyoto's city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible."</seg>

<seg id="395">"the protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was zapped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains."</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their minor son or her minor daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof above the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that children have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the practice described as Criaazgo is widespread in Paraguay, due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduation, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criaazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated with the Crimean is generally not silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" make something out "can be handed over to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family that welcomes the girl with her and whose exploitation with faith justifies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in Paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent strikes. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"it was Criadita in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their home in Vaquería, a small village with just 3000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira arrived with a stick on Marín until she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply involved in the practice of Criaazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>

<seg id="449">"without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>

<seg id="455">"the Crimean tas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to work all, and began selling sweets on the street or market in order to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and desinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make supper for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>

<seg id="500">"image of Pixabay, edited by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently voted in favour of a draft law on "the regulations of use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if accepted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a job would then be set up which is mandated to give citizens permission to issue social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video coaching and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattler, parliamentary deputy and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall blocked by Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level on Facebook. as a result, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technician (Senior Research Technician) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly believe in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that as they are forcibly physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, this means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court case."</seg>
<seg id="517">"technically, this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense control is maximized and ensured that no divergent narration is present on the image area, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal welfare campaigner Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards fighting through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and growth of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a qualified biologist, Raza enjoys a passion for another side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for North East Japan, documented the progress that was achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture has been an official prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring counties Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated because the tsunami had lost whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima prefecture has yet witnessed a nuclear accident, and alone 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local perspective what progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (the" "Erigai kouei juchaku" ") prefectures were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the disaster, evacuated shelters from shelters (" "to casetsu juchaku" ") will be relocated to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, almost 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster was settled in final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned.</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have been affected extensively."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural lands, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland from Fukushima lie in the" nuclear wave zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent on the same level, as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the population lives, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuates."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed found that still not enough in catastrophes prevention was done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 evacuated refugees from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people were relocated back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 state, 40,000 residents of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated refugees who still live in shelters are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the popular congregation of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were laundered.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after succumbing, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long period of inactive time are in operation because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembered to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a subject for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became intolerable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, sugar prices rose about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report" Agricultural prospects "published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations agricultural and food organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will come into history with certainty," "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero."</seg>
<seg id="653">"from then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry started."</seg>
<seg id="654">"in the following years, a total of 98 sugarcane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" scam. ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first year of apparition, the first letters began to come."</seg>
<seg id="661">"these were officially written documents, which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date."</seg>
<seg id="662">"everyone was signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was overwritten and the letters came more and more frequently."</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that had been harvested in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">"Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma."</seg>
<seg id="666">"he was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped."</seg>

<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work lander has been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">"in many cases, there were no alternatives for the employment and services generated in the communities in which they were located."</seg>
<seg id="670">"we will never know if during the Mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the former president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years, everything would run well."</seg>

<seg id="675">"when the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to measure it, they also stopped asphaling the road, this also disadvantaged other farms."</seg>
<seg id="676">"without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories."</seg>
<seg id="677">They became replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">"without a prospect of the future, many young people left the region."</seg>
<seg id="679">"a food factory was created in the area, whose production is not even intended for the supply of the municipality."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshops are bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North Quebec and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop encourages young participants to talk about topics such as" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the trunk of the Kithumkal First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages, although young people do not always speak the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is at your disposal, as is a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I keep trying to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"this way, they can grow and also lead our youth forward"</seg>
<seg id="712">"in this way, they can do what they intended for the Creator."</seg>

<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanmau (see the" "Plastic Models of the Courts" ") of any dish that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokiosk district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies, who produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"with Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sane."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new plastic dishes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food products is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an emperor-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part of the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there anyone who would say," "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughter?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of national and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and killed regulars regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the sine cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse lies behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político summoned the digital project" "Leak a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "to live with drug trafficking" "), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by traffickers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video entitled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(german:" "like fear life" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend."</seg>

<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have asked to go and to search for tombs, according to the people we loved."</seg>

<seg id="767">"on October 13, he left the house."</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"my mother, too, is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">"at the moment, she has no income."</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay her out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">"where shall we get them?" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come by newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The hopelessness of man is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being "soaked."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family was robbed with threats. ""</seg>

<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, for they do not know when they will lead you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence, and he had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home, saw the bloody corpse of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born as Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders according to the citizens' council for public security and government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "render a Vivir Con El Narco", "Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." no one was left behind to count bodies, "said a Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the event for the attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example mistakenly deleted the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who could flee were punches, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence associated with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally participate in tearing the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue, and the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">"the spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here, for example)."</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the worry that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and giving them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to be discussed about violent demonstrations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be replaced by context or completely abusive manner."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017. the march launched at the Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens Front for the Neural Testing of Debts) and the ecumenical Church meeting of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishment of debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which has been published last year and is available free of charge, contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>

<seg id="1190">"this book seeks to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what is the true cost associated with this."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the nebula that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences."</seg>

<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the Adra-prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>

<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police Bassel "had taken part in Adra as a" strictly secret "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Germany, a designer, technologist, and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more provisionally than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here, Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would do all about this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this stripe in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak good English."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a rehearsal that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger on the corruption of corruption in which a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his prison sentence, in which corruption was perpetrated."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defendants for dispersal of 54 million Metikal (some 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who evaluated the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to repay his old post because the company did not carry any disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many residents do not welcome the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>

<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company apparently remained silent, however, and did not cause appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disgusting. ""</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splinters.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censuses the word" "Kalar" "or" "s" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely derogatory connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, were censored in order to express their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same character sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play of words."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hats believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it destroys all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facthook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy does not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I prohibited the liking, posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail" was not consistent with the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefit, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"the post states" "If you are a doctor, then cure people?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is to increase the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflict between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to take control of the rampant hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look around in context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this uncomplicated thing, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained herself, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series revolve against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now submerged."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform transferred all Turkish Wikipedia sites to its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"however, the content is available in spite of the legal ban."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the ban on Wikipedia), we set out to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar patterns if banned in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take pictures that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helped him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wild animal photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) invoked me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he was to know [it], for he had already seen tigers face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late at night. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the Buhark appeared. he immediately sat down, we looked at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit: I click on environmental protection) on its photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"his passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wildlife, however, is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband and fear the consequences should they disregard the norm, keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo court and expelled from her family and village community after having appealed to a married relative with name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of not naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, operated by the Community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paine has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS-infected individuals, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how this club has created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion round, acted by women who did not name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open a conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands loudly is a custom, which they all uphold and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini points out:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"in the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pai in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise she just sat down in front of herself; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put on the women's head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot, if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion during each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to take care of who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things that they never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have never talked so frankly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them are okay, but some wanted to wear a salem-kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the merits of the choice of clothing, the moral connected with the saris and much more, Rohini ornamented her own pair of kurtas (upper shirts) in a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are coming slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then again listening to the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and tells other people about what we're talking about, and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Volunteers community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos of stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of bald persons for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelieving purposes, disregards the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently made use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man can reveal gold or bring wealth, said the police officer at Zambézia of the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the target of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in South Africa conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">"the persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice."</seg>

<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mordecabala, province of Zambézia, for presumably dissipative rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this attracts the police of the Republic of Mozambique."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized because of liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(sovereign risk), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" an internal matter, "and a spokesman says that he considered it" not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country. ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nonetheless, China will continue to get calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to release his or her treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject."</seg>

<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume exports to China, as the exports have largely been blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>

<seg id="1654">"the US Embassy's request drew a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that is, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "twist logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifice, to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a land."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanencouragement were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of which he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities that are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre returns from authoritarian rulers who pretended to be Democrats, abandoned the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-replies to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He did not respond to such questions with rational methods.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high enough to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the full board of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven important even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was" "no country," "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this correctly and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "benign a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are viewed as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel cutout?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"Journey of a Decade, the magazine Journey of a Decade, tends to be a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" "the defense of the country especially" "etc., but this is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">"your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors uncovered about certain parts of the world and another facet to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I asked most in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and live in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification is usually followed by the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians perhaps cook in anger when they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know each other, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All loved Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">"Americans, on the other hand,...."</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago, before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"we obviously say" "sorry" "very often."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter to me, if one would confuse me for example with Johnny from Dallas."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" nice "is basically to be idle - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has a Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward in fact. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and don't deserve to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main characteristic of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders call" "nice" "is perhaps just cool courtesy."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open kindness which I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau then entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band celebrated in Thailand published a music video, which parodies the Junta, which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what regulations his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists warned the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the Army absolute decision making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the infamous program for" alteration "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered by the junta as a critic."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit in the army was also set up, which monitors online content and prosecuted people accused of having slandered the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand continues a strict law against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic Discharge).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison, because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the Salut from" The Hunger Games, "which was already used by coup opponents during the 2014 protests."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is run by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenque and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Afrika."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2,50 the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, the people come in full bans and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out:" Mama Afrika! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some even have slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel it fits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister hoping to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on the way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Afrika." Mama Afrika is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the track and that Africans are already speaking at Whatsapp by Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Afrika since months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "he answers, smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send their text messages when they went away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he escaped with his wife and three children from people who wanted to press money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the aisles, the travellers calmly consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves with numerous photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair care, she has made her a kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she imagines her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya I fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang, by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the Communication, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police report that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic Web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme tassures and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet" Images from mainland China "(" images from mainland China "), censored news in China, displayed photos of a checkpoint in which police officers checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjan make sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without this software, they may be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Mao's China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (in addition to a Jingwang product description) also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council of the City to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office at the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police station."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible violations, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the series" "sleep or death", "in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and make sure you are alone in a place where everything is missing."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identifiable, both from the inside and from the outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all honour to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One who has settled down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality catches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood, and everything screams after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the earth is spinning on the axis of evil. it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone have been erected."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to" learn my lesson, "as the leader of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were ripped during a peaceful protest like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" cries.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the neighborhoods sought, but my own not."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I didn't put any high demands on a city, which is plugged into the arteries with state safety organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night things had calmed down somewhat, after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped working."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I interrupted the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice contrasted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations wholeheartedly."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"at such a moment, you realize that you are liberating the mind from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the Military Security Council."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screamed it all the way to the office of the Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the Colonel, Ghassan, stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan begins to speak:" let me hear how you scream "Allahu Akbar," or you are only courageous enough to shout if we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His eyes filled with water.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you are really sorry to see me in my eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my cause when I replied: "I wouldn't have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking in my eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, with that."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this accursed sentence is still in my nose today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome," "a mental torture I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the farm and into the second office, which leads through a walk to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I take a look at all the details before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they probably have assigned me a larger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one more prisoner, and can immediately set me up without waiting for her permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell and I resorted to an old tried and tested method of communication: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell comrade was a "first-hanger."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"after a long hesitation, he finally answered me."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and called" "the doctor." ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in the perfect darkness there are no visible facial features to me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny their existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would let him go if I stay.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would have liked to have had a scarecrow, to drive out all these crows, which refresh themselves in the fruits in the garden of my head."</seg>

<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that Schwarz was the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light, which presented us horror in person: the Raad (about:" thunder, "alluding to the 13th prostitute of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"this revealed the secret: to protect state security from us and prevent us from exposing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - so they played out their denominational blackmail and betrayed the close view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, which is not a country here; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clans into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me like that."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the expressions that follow him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest demonstrations that will soon end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished, although I had nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner will delight in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams didn't fail him enough, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator used to work as a trash collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they intertwined four cables intertwined, in order to present the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped shouting."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it, which is why he acted as the next to an electrically charged rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to store my whole quarter."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body, stretched out on the floor, was the perfect conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again; let's say, that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, which happened to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens, and the morning light fills the room." Raus with you, Arschfucker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my Father has to worry about terrible troubles."</seg>

<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old-tried opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with issues like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that go from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion to the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian winged from the second generation, "he describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think, because I am a man," "while he poured into water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a scorching hot juncture has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the muzzle of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled the performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputies and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert had" "just" "been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which is the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not simply be mere rhetoric, but rather reflect an ever more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib repatriated traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of an apparently lowered unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women, who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past years, the number of" "honour killings" "has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can" "be detained indefinitely in prison", "and their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also, Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that long as taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, not politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intimated to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib is attacking the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and" "Ghareeb", "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in essence can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse repeats conspicuously:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan about gay rights and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya, to remember later that his commentary was torn from the context, twisted and his opinion censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib openly advocates the Arab LGBTQ + community and thinks that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuevo, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered thanks to his homoerotic poems today."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuis, who was to work on behalf of the caliph later, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic realm, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices would be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service had established several former government decrees and members of the teacher's association with the rationale that they had critical comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is continuous giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially created democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and resists resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great extravagant war puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feeders, drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the west marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>

<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two forlorries are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outside appearance and body care were so important as in this story, as they help to keep Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has resulted in getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unparalleled demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts compete against each other in order to show who one of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and receive training in hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:"</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, as we have built up this educational community out of love for the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled, accommodating affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"precisely this question left the two young Colombian militants Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, inspired by the campaign Cartas por la Vliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the sign of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of a genuine reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and carried arms around the clock, must now reintegrate into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up these ranks and support them in setting up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombians could join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, to be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more urgently."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, which needed urgent attention."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and build a new life." "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN stores in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Council of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up as they had done before to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support for people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a co-worker of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a sort of cottage where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because beside him on the bed lay a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he said," "I answer a letter someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful to me, so I answer it." "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"and I embraced him, and sat down beside the garnet."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, it was a pity to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there who waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have learned only how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the start, students and some of the leaders of the FARC met for a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have witnessed how the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and hated even humans with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something, and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"according to the Colombian people, peace would reign after disarmament."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to weapons, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology belong to them - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed by the LGBTQ community at the local LGBTQ community did not come into being overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines once reports have been published that address the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, who took suspicious queens and put them in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chetsch had experienced the gender equation of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she moved to the USA in the last analysis."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day someone told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while trying to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with my telephone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents through WhatsApp made the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on October 10, 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying," "Here's a gift for you from your uncle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard another sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "how long will you still honor the family, you scandstain?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that it was a young man, not thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything and started shouting.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in the men's or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having treated respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad things, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the entire republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she put a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering me, without ID, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think you are safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it's the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"we don't talk about the gender balance, however, that's a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really bother to look like the person she reminds of her past - so to my male shape."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">"Sabrina: last week, I filed a report in Washington."</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not finish a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end ask for proof that the so-called" honor "has undergone gratification through blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine tells me, there would be no very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are detained there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to become radicalised."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think that already before 2003, I was already known in the whole of Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, back then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to bring us to" civilisation, "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never even bent me on a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't know about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never chased and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but above all about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, it was possible to sense how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who smiled and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic ever worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teetraffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"I discovered these people myself, when I clicked off places of refuge."</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature is, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay ones."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan have what, the cabarins have what, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet, they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of a transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, in order to be precise, different settings of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all because I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi, on August 27, drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, such as Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which much of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran is located, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy acquired power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most productive and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime denies Ahwazi-Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a wide range of dams to transfer water from the Arab areas to the Persian territory, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, graduated from 55% a secondary school and graduated with 45% of university degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "led to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activist activist alarm, before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, including intersectionalism"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixliay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the statement, written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women - who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even lay well-thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women earn less money nowadays despite the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life sooner or later, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is known to me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on black women, on black women women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift their voices "and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to" sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about sexualized violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are facing black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I too refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is in historical terms a fragmented and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to promote their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to close white women the importance of the overlap of skin color and sex, because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women different origin a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than engaging me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever to define black women for our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book" "Africana womanismus" "(about: Africa-Womanismus: how we recapture ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has neither crossed, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"Todd Reubold's contribution was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that is particularly concerned about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"Nabil Musa travelled again and again in the past seven years, mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "Musa recounts."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no more water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia von Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay". "the article is part of the series # PorserMujer (# harlicheinefraubin), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman appeared Balbuena for abuse, also Ada Báez reported nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved back to her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women at all reimburse ad, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 Strikes and Statistics 2 Invisible mistreatments and a legal system that does not imply endorsement of Paraguayans: good approach, inadequate implementation punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Egyms, a socio-scientific research facility in Paraguay." there are several indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads were given to the District Attorney Office for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5,000 adverts due to domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of the women's advertisements came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"there are two women who don't do this," "she said at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to her estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want that, but then gave up. this should be regretted forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured the mental violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told him how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users surveyed Mariana why she had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, struggled for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in some way victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias case, everything started with psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an unobtrusive legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguayan law: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good but cannot be applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the announcement of abuse is a way of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nonnenmacher) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain feminid to an independent criminal offense and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the bill was changed in a number of ways in order to win the deputies for the law, which feared that the road to decriminalize abortions, which are currently banned in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill envisaged that most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence at present themselves, if they simply restore an advert and wish to obtain safe accommodation to the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>

<seg id="2588">"medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media, and is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of global healthcare.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by drug companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research conducted by African scientists will help to build up own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself was investigating the HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the Serbian healthcare system."</seg>

<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"that has to change, otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a mover."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is demand for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines can only make available for payment (the so-called" Paywall "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how open source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's contribution was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited by his own imagination and the question of how many types of salad he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cereals or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security ensure food safety is the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he now needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if there is a boulder in a river to addling.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce because all the features are already patented." "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tubes of the Outredgeous variety in the" "greenhouse" "of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is not by chance that this name sounds like this, as if the movement originated from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the free open source software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed that they bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy seeds, cross it to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member, Jack Kloppenburg, check on seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important to food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds play a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "open source" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed," "he says, and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are being offered on farmers markets, as it should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patents on seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates do not yet exist for other plants, but experts such as Luby assume that large-scale cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred so that they have specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. at present, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts, however, that intellectual property classifies other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not prevent innovation, but it promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"all in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant traits:" we do not really create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed masses of herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly opposite." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years," he says. "for 20 years I have been protected against competition with a patent, which makes it very easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be leading the" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, implements a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol works on an open source license, which is ultimately a formless and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"a statement, however, is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to find out about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for open source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for the next year's official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - published a report. it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seeds, exchange it and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes to see more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how things are grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their foods."</seg>

<seg id="2730">"now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider in which also Canada's blog is given a home, is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video of how the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the government and reflected what this meant for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege, an arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"now, however, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also documented the blocking of vendors, through which internet censorship and private surfing were possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how to block websites that VPNs offer."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these actions in court."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers are reporting in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "On the second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Diebe cooks pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air travel to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio, the newspaper" Extra "published on 16 August the editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced to set up a new category called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex offense, etc., but what happens from the civilized standard and what happens in Rio is published in the section" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">"extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world, with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war."</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes on:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to cover up."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not civilians but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harms more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argue against denying violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"in memory, the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2781">"one of these security policy measures was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease in violent death cases. but for some years, the UPP has been increasingly under bombardment after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor municipalities that should protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civilian is an insignificant point in the landscape and becomes the object of" collateral damage "and" lost bullets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime vis-à-vis loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute, The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>

<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebels have been under siege from rebel areas outside of Damascus, which led to the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smuggled foods."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alessida and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose the cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, like meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been campaigning for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alessida."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of about €12,700, but will continue to raise funds to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "production of fungal seeds coming from the regions" "before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on October 21, several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the northern part of Portugal during the week."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery alone in Portugal alone, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why the Civil Defence was unable to curb the scale of the tragedy as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal explained the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">"this Sunday they did not do this anywhere, there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire."</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could have happened in June as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the form of forest, which the government had made after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced an easing of the law, which permitted construction activity to be avoided if the applicant had the means of self-defence - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval writes in the same article of Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees from easily combustible wood could spread, as in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of Civil Defence of Portugal took place on 15 and 16 October when residents were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information for the population: it converted its own civil protection data through the application fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade, and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million requests."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape Asharaf found herself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than themselves, in order to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services and no heating there. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows, so that we could not freeze at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"at the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy two times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high ratings, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and untrained personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum, which can be deducted for months after the asylum application has been registered."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who don't have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible way of living helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf plucked all his savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian police, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the deprivation of elected president Mohamed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protesters, who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management failed, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan also threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, bogus exposure from among others weapons of arms, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza spoke to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for reporting the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>

<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
