this is James Ris@@ en .
perhaps you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has investigated the Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they stated years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to ris@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failing to make statements and ris@@ king statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly kept his telephone evidence , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel documents with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there is communication software that has not existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would require would not be available from the start . &quot;
&quot; however , Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to commit mis@@ deeds , it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental employee , the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t suggests . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rich and Mi@@ ghty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week , we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Law Fir@@ m Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; Ok@@ ay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a trail of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait very nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; probably , because so far there were no prominent Americans who were in this dis@@ closures , this scandal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are not enough Americans to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , some US states require less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US allows employees of school districts to rip off school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off especially prone investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator came out as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that everyone except one lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an isolated case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a scandal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very absurd as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that things have started to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen steps towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States hin@@ dered it .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I once almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a post@@ age sale . &quot;
one guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he enth@@ r@@ alled me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake ask him , &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Ah , how to please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , star@@ ing at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild ran@@ ger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sat on ti@@ led tips at the door and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who only waited for being discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate withdraw@@ s and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think Cre@@ ativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment is transformed into a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and me star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came in the roll .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
&quot; thus we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
&quot; however , they did not . &quot;
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you have to focus on things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the total experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense confidence between people who never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree trust we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting next to your neighbour .
this quiet approach from panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel like they stay overnight somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you tell us on Twitter that he was chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name , when he told you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
this is because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system significantly strengthens trust .
in the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to reject negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence . &quot;
we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it gets exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have fewer than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stands out in common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you say too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your home ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people are taking advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered beforehand .
&quot; for us , business runs very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , 123 million overnight stays were only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other to justice .
&quot; when trust works , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one .
&quot; you drive in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together ?
it is about economic commerce .
&quot; but now it &apos;s just &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; , &quot; the thing won &apos;t do justice . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people place a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait for a thorough re@@ fill and show a neighborhood in a pub that has never been heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to clas@@ hing ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would consider the idea of sharing ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships , rather than isolation and isol@@ ation@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
were now offered by residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were withdrawn . In@@ cub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why did it work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I ask myself what we will be able to use design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply delay the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , as some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , for me it was a declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , I had to adapt myself to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not just my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start building up . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I rode in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and when I heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday , that week -- the day when Muslims gathered for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on that first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims , with@@ ered into the open and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually say people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are useless because the question is false .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces free , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; regular visits to a mos@@ que leads to more tolerant people to other fai@@ ths , and show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently said : people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation , it has been determined that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ ties group may make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the terrorists to be the real Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop people going to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when looking at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought them to silence and said that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised their solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m re@@ stores the connection with God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; one study shows that when people submit messages reported negative about Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain oneself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit to Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , pulled my shoes off , went into the prayer room , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am not an exception in any way .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air pack@@ et production penet@@ rated into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks live in front of the audience . &quot;
&quot; by t@@ ying together , flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures independently .
&quot; they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ences and to react in general to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a depos@@ itor of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can fluctu@@ ate and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s okay .
&quot; during our research , we often place fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known around as machines with a thousand moving parts , which gather to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ holi@@ er , the mechan@@ ically most simple remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ation drives or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is simple , inside life a lot happens so that it can fly st@@ ably and move in space everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of just throwing it right away is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ holi@@ er is an exercise in practi@@ c@@ ality , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; in this way , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if also limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by fli@@ r@@ ting one half .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there wants to be on Broadway a flying lamp shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , smart creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes orbit each other in a very distant gal@@ axy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
&quot; finally , we speak of black holes . &quot;
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell lives were created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fishes , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , resulting from col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognised them as ins@@ ane geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector League : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition capacity enormously . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ro@@ cked through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and their observations for 23 years . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really old dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ aked at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt following the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can create an image or map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from multiple points . &quot;
&quot; in tones , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore , it is very difficult to produce a picture of things which mean a lot to you : &quot;
for example your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speaking . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , we can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just about : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same p@@ ine@@ apple with an additional key change . that sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following as sound from -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the All and hear the un@@ seen . &quot;
&quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through as these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love exploring the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own light @-@ light . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , said to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sour no@@ od@@ les for our arch@@ eological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o offers us a completely different perspective on what is happening in space , the creation of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the universe .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang himself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
have a dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; Yes &quot; to all that I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , my fear cleared . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it started with a question of my smallest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swa@@ m to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : first of all I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , think about life . &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I am producing TV .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production . &quot;
every consi@@ gn@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who still does that ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when talking about work so that you understand that I am not just walking around the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it is true when I say : I understand that it is not about dream job in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s the way to get a high note , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began to work and work and work and work and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum ! &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a hum@@ ming , then you cannot asp@@ ire to size differently . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ ma .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts and more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more things watch me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the h@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mo@@ m is one single work title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there but you can write to my n@@ anny .
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum was stopped . &quot;
the h@@ um of the engine collap@@ sed .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the h@@ um did not come back .
my h@@ um was broken .
&quot; I did the same thing as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the hum@@ ming I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Ha@@ y you , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you do , you work , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a hum@@ ming when you already know the hum@@ ming , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I doing ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , too late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I already want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; et@@ ching . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my h@@ um smo@@ kes , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sw@@ inging , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax pens and the song in which it is going to be released , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door is coming and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the h@@ um comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum , the sum of work , the titanium h@@ um , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I am describing with the help of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is no force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real h@@ um depends on love .
the hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I am doing it as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice as long as I want to hear the hum@@ ming again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t think about how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better working than to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I do . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ vely , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just 15 minutes , you don &apos;t need more . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a day !
&quot; no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it must not be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to play in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it out .
&quot; friends meet , read books , enjoy the day . &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes a day why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the h@@ um came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy is flowing in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the sum of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
&quot; and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play the more I hear the sum . the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the hum@@ ming , the sum , the other , the right amount : the sum of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , captiv@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life is in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel the sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures .
&quot; they have certainly heard from one of the best known , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; the electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered under severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story started 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; they have to imagine that , in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain rises and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes a part of s@@ wollen brain mass must be removed . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to all small children who are taken out of their families .
&quot; you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed it . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can turn into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our bra@@ ins .
they make 4 % of our brain cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; this , however , is not that safe . &quot;
one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they then highlight colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we reim@@ ported them at the reception stage of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ en@@ anti@@ ate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we could work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we brought the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were taken back , they go back home . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we color in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; here , of course , we couldn &apos;t stop . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from one tray .
they did that very well .
&quot; as they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the mot@@ oric area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed ; they could no longer move their hand .
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey that picked up spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we reim@@ ported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that they were very exciting for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ge@@ dness .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remain completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a genuine democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are bri@@ bed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently poses a threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the twin peaks Par@@ ad@@ ox .
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations which , however , are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income generating the debt mountain and also producing all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds after much money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and drive real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , supports the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in an endless loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up , &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily brings about the circumstances that cause the body to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
&quot; his exceedingly lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is , that it with@@ drew the working poor , and that it was not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that it granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same m@@ oods in questions of state concerns . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , by gradually under@@ mining politics and dis@@ ma@@ yed them . &quot;
wondering why politicians are no longer like in the past ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; it is because nowadays one can be in the government and still not in power , because the power is emig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors , who have dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that at the end it is therefore star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has can@@ ni@@ zed politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , the inequality increases , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managers of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economics and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin peaks become higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the company is like in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used and people indulge their energy into the study of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in the near future . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all revenues come from capital and from rede@@ emed , and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the sphere of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re @-@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is simultaneously liber@@ ating in which it prefers privileged individuals and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do we not do it , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is ter@@ med Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely in@@ verteb@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not crazy , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to do so now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected it was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency and constant denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial . &quot;
&quot; right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose denial . &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to keep alive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , claims that he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the don@@ or &apos;s sides to find a common solution .
but that was not possible .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; none of the Troika &apos;s credi@@ tors , who imposed this policy on us , stood up : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you still seem to be pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studio
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an im@@ itation and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a highly competitive industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows received this rating .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where after you looked at a squ@@ ad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not concerned about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium pa@@ yout , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for nothing , then one attacks , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or watch again . &quot;
they collect millions of data in order to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course of the shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about viewers : what shows they like , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; you have two very competitive , data se@@ ed@@ ged companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says that it should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis doesn &apos;t work that way , it &apos;s a bit sc@@ ary because we &apos;re living in a time where we &apos;re going to get more and more statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is carried out or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always creating the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predicted through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year around year by year until it suddenly stopped working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data stream into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use lots of data to make serious choices , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
&quot; over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , disman@@ tle this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a branch , set the individual parts together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience why they wouldn &apos;t have been able otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant they had a big personal risk with that decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This is what the data say to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before data was available , this was the device for decision @-@ making . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will try it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much smar@@ ter than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the huge amount of data still pays out to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
