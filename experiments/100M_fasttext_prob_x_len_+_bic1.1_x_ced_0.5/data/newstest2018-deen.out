Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that will change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers farms the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich fo@@ sters exciting stories on days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows everyone who had to get excited because the car navigation system instead of a b@@ ypass road showed a green meadow .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ at@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet precisely because of this very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then it becomes clear , how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that can be recognized as such .
&quot; for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; documents &quot; &quot; were incorporated into the great map . &quot;
these were made according to the Bavarian association of sur@@ veying between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
their Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph further drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
the original composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek &apos; website .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered flush from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original recording &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small par@@ c@@ els now show no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was actually still a meadow - and not a concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; on the guest @-@ dough &quot; or on the rise &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ Institute &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ nen &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the accus@@ ation of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use force against occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; there was first place for 280 patients , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Haar in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting in the area of the former institution .
the Order purchased the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
&quot; west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was built in 2015 - architec@@ turally based on the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the shopping street was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city center . &quot;
a large one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once situated at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizens voting group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ mers &apos; promotion has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to become effective until 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges African @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim against minorities , prompted the group to issue warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of the civil rights that people pass .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .
&quot; the group quoted incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring cash or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime reporting program , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ p a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ bar@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Association of CD@@ U met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , where he managed 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ated in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only Region@@ ales arrives .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ f@@ ences project as &quot; fundamental . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on such steep areas , I cannot achieve profitable economies . &quot;
&quot; the grass@@ land area is a lot of work , much needed to be handled with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he did not run any bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is glad to be the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they will continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total costs amoun@@ ting to 71 500 euros , half was promoted via leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and ma@@ i@@ dens . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Protection Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art sponsor@@ ship of female f@@ ences .
the aim is to disclose the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be tu@@ bel@@ ated ( incl@@ ination of more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ f@@ ences project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 12@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence , the carefully staged down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals by the President for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he gra@@ bbed the meaning , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem on which you relate that was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is really right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your arms , / your afflicted masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable tr@@ ash &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ ump USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict of the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of her death - knew very well that she performed a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus am@@ ended the significance of the statue , the right wing people wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives , bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
she is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the torch is not supposed to ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
&quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled upon something here . &quot;
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; her torch is not meant to illumin@@ ate the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which will start on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special is being developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team as a team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alists , who compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , say that it is &quot; &quot; unbelievable &quot; &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir runs on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that one should watch after a great season involving the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also be involved in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me , it makes me something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Scot@@ ts belonging to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there .
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t get around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the burning of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles . &quot;
&quot; he shr@@ ank in the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said a lot of people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; this is a Repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , blocking individuals who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound . &quot;
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans of Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not like this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
that shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck his lead . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence her .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Ar@@ cher@@ field to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance @-@ Club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the program in the year I had won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour following his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home soil . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh , said . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy as to how it has been done .
&quot; the trio in the field are the former masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer rates caused by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are present in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases can be attributed to passive smoking a year , &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably close to time , &quot; said the director of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the background , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is always obstruc@@ ting the construction , represents a major problem for the construction tru@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ atta in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually design@@ ates a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the carb@@ oni@@ zed tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a shel@@ tered room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea took part in the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is bar@@ ren . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there are no public transport links .
&quot; the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs that have been converted by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has treas@@ ury resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has kept a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid close to 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian army . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Convention on Human Rights .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , we call for all &quot; polishing , &quot; in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric shock are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung caf@@ et@@ erias serve roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua , the M@@ om Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ho@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua a little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ho@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ho@@ i &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a grav@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; on December 7th , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - running in the circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to hur@@ l stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist@@ ed more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that was not approved by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta only the following day .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ho@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackl@@ ing these violations , but there are processes that must go through &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to accused the UN for &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; that claimed more than 1,000 dead victims in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already settled in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident ) . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the notion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will give revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ ch@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to take account of the officers and to withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an instrument of trouble for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua @-@ Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily deta@@ ined , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each of which can handle four or five fields of the sweet potato . &quot;
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten scores of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new flight routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; for instance , Papua has rarely invested capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua ( although the rare permission to film ) was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ho@@ is &apos;s election campaign were not realized in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most comfor@@ ting provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa den@@ i@@ dency and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ undry ) . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman for the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on the 4th of May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the session but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ho@@ v@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , are in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ho@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock ) and cooled down the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building following its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage was caused by the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup debut only on two winning sets , chi@@ ef@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much valued Five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to carry out the final in a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the following year .
&quot; in order to reduce costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited objects into the plane , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among flying passengers revealed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 per cent , while they accidentally bearing forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people , conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; of the respon@@ dents , who admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent gave to know@@ ingly borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought to the airport security , and how many had intentionally done it . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly the most frequently . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncertain about which fluids they may take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items banned by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that the T@@ SA could consider books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ lined that some of the customers have already pulled back their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly survey : the cancellation in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just started . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are present at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; its argument is that the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500,000 - one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available . &quot;
&quot; those who order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines , never before in practice , with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if there are major delays , the im@@ possibility of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in pairs . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt to withdraw due to dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environment Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions @-@ causing pollutants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of the state &apos;s environmental authorities as compared to previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 o@@ zone standards . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ uted by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a for a long time , was a reliable opponent of severe environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations for the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ stance regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA did not meet the deadlines for execution and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others and agreed to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we take the law and the authority it gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month will delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York @-@ based At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group wanted to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case New York closed California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil @-@ Oz@@ on arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the emerging smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ eck &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it &apos;s disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos;s Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen is invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 at 4.@@ 30@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ customiz@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the documents according to the documents , on the Tum@@ linger hill , apart from the former parish church , there was also a wonderful courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village @-@ picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the wonderful settlement @-@ nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 are under@@ pinn@@ ed by these historical circumstances .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , continued to remain the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two cr@@ un@@ ches on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed over to the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; during the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half fell . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years of the old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , a local leader , speaks the final word . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is available from 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers offer fantastic views . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the care of home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to test permit of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is not a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
the Association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is warded &quot; by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the boundary of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ ment &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had agreed a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a lack of form@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; according to Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim , Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim , is resist@@ ing the lack of planning legal requirements . &quot;
&quot; the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; the approval of the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out by law . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been made in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; explains a spokesman . &quot;
the circle takes them to test the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are area . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded fat@@ ally .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained blocked for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took her car in the course of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and distributor plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
the Gewerbe@@ verein and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to attract the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend is to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the city &apos;s own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market , is planned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; P@@ lars di Me@@ zzo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action not only targets inhabitants of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
the Municip@@ ality and Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; as a result , the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day , &quot; to well as the well @-@ sold Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts to actively participate in active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be newly developed or re @-@ developed . &quot;
this includes visitors and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of downtown while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly wi@@ ped , king had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen announced that the third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day will take part in five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment by himself .
two dead and several wounded after an explosion at US school
&quot; during the construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; at a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ gade , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was another injured in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed in the explosion .
a first missing was later also found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a cause of failure , the authorities presum@@ ed to work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy at the holiday time .
Tr@@ ump put pressure on telephone calls Mexico after tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president insul@@ ted him because he denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise of establishing a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA wander@@ ed to Australia to take over &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; depot &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the USA .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and insp@@ ected through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man shou@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; get it out of your car ! &quot;
cries tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a reflection . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked out very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights activists joined Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were le@@ aked by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a lifel@@ ong citizen .
&quot; for him , post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been free on foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice of Georgia enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the FBI , the black farmers Roger Mal@@ com fell down a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , as the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they were removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual delivery of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their depic@@ tion is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ x because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - entered a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ yard for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ man Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ wan , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;
&quot; the play begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the high priest cries and drives him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ wan rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks ( at least every black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ ita asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ b@@ bling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; have said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot;
you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy trying to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ ita says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in mourning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays , mour@@ ners &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many just come down the street . &quot;
they have spent nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial grounds of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per together . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; said a little boy , as though he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ord and wipe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man who played the clan member .
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks into her arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; said one of the women . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you have done that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience gets together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair from Atlanta chat@@ ted about the post @-@ production with a black couple that they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words what feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people that look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today this is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks keeps court at his table , eating and re@@ members the civil rights . &quot;
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ ulate is in a way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is putting on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) can optionally be found in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR , or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car parks where the Rhine fun@@ nels are pos@@ ing as a rock wind , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that is moving through his &quot; Ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine fun@@ nels - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ izes perfectly as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag a body into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wal@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fu@@ cked Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he s@@ miles Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it . &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who humble himself and his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; there is a great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the high heat again in casual leisure wear . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a g@@ ellen@@ ic pipe concert , five years later , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced over this .
&quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its point of view . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max is working as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I am helping in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years now , i.e. a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I graduated from Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off . &quot;
&quot; I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do ?
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester .
&quot; I am going to study dual , I am probably doing a social worker &apos;s education in Youth Her@@ ne and studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you turn your FS@@ J .
it can be done from retirement homes to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
what is different from civil engineering studies ?
&quot; lot : well , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; there are always other people in front , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are times negative moments , but that is how life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business &quot;
&quot; British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut off its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as a further restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced , mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in a third cost reduction program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul Con@@ voy attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , an Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say function@@ aries . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and announced a NATO Declaration .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump sums up the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it will show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone provisions in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards , in order to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is said to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and nature conservation groups concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function , and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
municipal council wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ kels concludes the establishment of a common room in the future sen@@ iors residence . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the plot is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will take a long time before the area belonging to the church community has now belonged to the community , there is no need for planning a plan for the project to be carried out by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are suspended from seeing such a common space just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ anism , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the running household in autumn , is made by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as a pul@@ sed roof - which would reduce the amount of tr@@ uss and make the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; un@@ necessarily , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes , is this additive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps , he passes the body unanim@@ ously . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with which one can &apos;t move so well , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , &quot; she says , &quot; I am hard doing that . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking about the communal space - but absolutely against a community involvement .
&quot; it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy , or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , there is no surplus , but will get a real equivalent , in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; the motion of Sta@@ ig@@ ers , to split the proposal accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is thrown down on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer way out of direction Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior W@@ ant wanted to cross the road at the edge of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction gave priority to him .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage .
Bayern Munich has to miss the World Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel , the FC Bayern will become the first mandatory game for the new season in Dortmund . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German football record company Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; the Mün@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good at all . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have a lot of confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expected a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights fascin@@ ates the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; accommod@@ ates the need for information for many har@@ z@@ go@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he bin@@ ds nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tablets should be added to the internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewer experiences a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it is far away . &quot;
it is also convey@@ ed in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Göttingen Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ planet &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the Sun is measuring 70 centimet@@ ers away exactly 75 meters away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet trail is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the Plu@@ to , it takes a good hour to reach the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN &apos;s offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the unbe@@ aten World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion . &quot;
&quot; following Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ zer on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
&quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ s &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to get down to lightweight .
and he has to move on light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what fans demand .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their light weight title fight in the forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko insisted on the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show punch strength , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after bur@@ sting
&quot; in case of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; following initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car sli@@ pped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured through the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 in the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , An@@ other Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; that were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a free blast does not want to catch the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; for the future , there will be no one else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better after the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four @-@ leg@@ ged chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the three chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make so many mis@@ leading mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether you can speak after a draw from an un@@ successful start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about this .
&quot; I only judge the start into the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the play of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are at the moment , &quot; says the inside defense of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland take the chance to get a favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium , Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as head coach . &quot;
meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum seek@@ er application tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medic@@ inal@@ k@@ et ) have begun performing the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they are to take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work ent@@ ails assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they used to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we can &apos;t confi@@ dently say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the paper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of in@@ correctly assessing a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Government of the Government of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began at the same time at all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the end of the building is scheduled for October , and it is certain that the schedule will be met . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come to the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side , a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons wei@@ ghted so @-@ called bridge deck . &quot;
&quot; this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as an operating way . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge deck is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to go .
&quot; the special feature is that it involves finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip sensitivity has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting pond towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach location , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges is 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the district parliament ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the poster &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the town picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well pla@@ za , but is now taking place on the car park below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the relevant organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many function@@ aries to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Ei@@ fel reports that he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ au@@ splatz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at around 8@@ pm , a band for entertainment in the Stad@@ thalle , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidates for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special occur@@ ren@@ ces .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or just &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in Europe &apos;s top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; the solo@@ ist of the famous Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam , Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and the free play become a fascinating piece of art . &quot;
this core of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with their particular acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and they will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with each other , whom I have given . &quot;
or do you think I had played it ?
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never confused me or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; I only liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially among them , she said loud &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school , as she prefers to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public does not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to react in some way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would prevent us from working again in order to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport . &quot;
&quot; Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were gra@@ bbed with gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has experienced some very hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , we have to do everything to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , which start in London on Friday , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
soldiers crashed in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the Northern H@@ essi@@ an Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers in Mali have thought about the soldiers . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained case of crash .
&quot; they described the two opposite pilots , however , as &quot; experts of their profession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief of staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
&quot; their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany , accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St Peter . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
&quot; among these were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; roses laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
before the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen called the opposite soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sh@@ attered .
the Chief of Staff has built the flight operations of the combat helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; in doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen did not show that the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral Church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also de@@ ferred the title &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - neither after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always hel@@ pless , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy state in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first few years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk h@@ ul@@ ls instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia @-@ Tob@@ acco and who had the reputation to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
this was because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
&quot; previously , the unexpected exit of a Green party from its state parliament in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a heavy crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the state elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green @-@ Democratic MEP El@@ ke T@@ essa founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; group leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his group to include them . &quot;
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , the SPD and the Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Parliament will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether to continue ruling in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the country &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s confidence and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be insp@@ ected legally , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the de@@ vil@@ ed de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land meeting .
&quot; we , of course , assume that she has given immediate effect to her country of land , which she has received through the green country list , &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the group leader of the Green Party , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ essa . &quot;
she consciously decided not to speak any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; also against the background , that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ung to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the German Social @-@ Democrats Group on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly elect the Parliament . &quot;
the exit of T@@ ern@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her van@@ ishing vanity and fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to make political capital out of it .
Dutch &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ essa in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ ires to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal car@@ eers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force in the SPD , and the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier isn &apos;t really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the acquaint@@ ance of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk evaluation are available to consumers .
&quot; as well as the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if the residual contents of eggs are exceeded from 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not air@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ polluted eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the companies are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , production plants do not bear immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as usual , there is too little controller in the case of harvest . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
&quot; there were , however , the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and secure food . &quot;
&quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly considered . &quot;
&quot; by means of the counter@@ f@@ eit money , manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the facts will be clari@@ fied quickly and comprehen@@ sively . &quot;
how the football rules of the football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered spending on European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid $ 2@@ 22 million ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s reloc@@ ation to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make money , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes down and bring it to a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the Q@@ at@@ ari power rich in energy . &quot;
&quot; clubs may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources , which allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period that runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini has dropped from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to frigh@@ ten himself from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum total of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million can be reported in the financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs seeking to over@@ lay their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar will be am@@ bass@@ adors and that such manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing up .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the football over the last 15 years , &quot; Mr. Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can deal with different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate on board chocolate for the Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet collaboration is coming to an end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; each year , around 17 million small red @-@ white packed chocolate bars distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual revenues of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; but more importantly , it is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ cker manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; like many applicants , Swiss Life does not want to disclose it . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for a statement . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board of their flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut also supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for an attractive jar of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - yet they managed to win back the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering can principle , including a riff on the stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point rum@@ bles a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy malicious plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ sung impression by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as usual , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s side@@ burns of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will attend the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East @-@ versus @-@ West ring @-@ fight icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ised in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always attending the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in hitting the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials assured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; during the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 police officers were deployed . &quot;
&quot; members of the Ma@@ fia are accused of organised crime crime , heavy violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; as early as summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in Southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was an active exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Italian nationals moved to the Italian Ma@@ fia with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s account . &quot;
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there might cause serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in an analysis published in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , according to the Register , 10 million people with foreign citizenship are included , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the data is managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany . &quot;
&quot; because the data has not been adequately maintained , the quality of data in parts has not yet been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; of people who have long ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data inputs can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who wouldn &apos;t have to leave . &quot;
&quot; however , such false assignments led to a distorted debate on dealing with tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; states therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 year old children once they have entered from there . &quot;
&quot; this is based on an internal paper published by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this paper , it is said that BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper has been relying on the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU @-@ state that they reach first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
I have given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send back refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Yel@@ ts@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a danger to child welfare . &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in a total of 220 liters of blood from those living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot;
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , especially Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the congregation hon@@ ors the multi @-@ fold willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher &apos;s Regional Development Manager , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre house has led to higher attendance figures a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multi @-@ winners and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eck , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter sold ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their lif@@ eli@@ ke . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it maintained interest rates on family income in the midst of increased pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members increasing in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest rate increases would be necessary to rein the inflation forecast by Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; scale than the markets would expect . &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year , adjusted down@@ wards , are expected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May . &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; according to these news , the pound was against the dollar and the euro . &quot;
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change will occur after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on a interest rate rise , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households concerned with rising inflation and minor wage increases , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse at first , before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent in@@ comes &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which is partly offset by lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the fall of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final judgement on interest rates , the call for interest rates was rising , as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the exceed@@ ance in relation to its goal of 2 % was to &quot; wholly &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn in Swa@@ p rates , the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ ended and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are completed , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the high court against financing the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health care via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alle@@ gation that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ p prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission among infections .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified which agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed at targeted and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of modi@@ fying the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delayed implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt will bring us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society .
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi , from Not@@ ting Hill , to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ tain lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all jo@@ ys and j@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
folding cu@@ is@@ ines are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went into it , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is obj@@ ection@@ able , so that when you push the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor - or how your property is valued , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; they managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; you do not fall into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from some standard into something amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers struggle for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers reside four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of Victori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate imperi@@ alists worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties valued at more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city area , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property has $ 3@@ 16 million and has valued $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of problem for Paul .
&quot; the comments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing by the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul affir@@ ms , has excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but accused Paul of managing several possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms . &quot;
Ms. de Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen businesses from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first jeans in the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke and Mark are said , &quot; Paul says , &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept himself very reluct@@ ant even though he was a former member of the AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ ck me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;

new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House staff chief is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information falling into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; political cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep drunk Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay . that &apos;s okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit has ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot;
perhaps these fighting officials know something that we do not know - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have even more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his associates managed it several times to keep anger from him , their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons , to supply doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ciously offered a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alle@@ gations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started questioning people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former chief of staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe send out postcards to dangerous criminals this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and requested . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action , which follows the winter season on the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; advent calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many refugees hide themselves at destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 Post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online reviews have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a rift and return to the &apos; million@@ aire &apos; row
&quot; some of West Mid@@ lands &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners are back on foot with some resol@@ ute travelers , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the church in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their men &apos;s homes . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire range . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their invasion . &quot;
the intact group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They went there on Monday evening after being sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced through shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , moved on and are back now . &quot;
&quot; more arrived last night , probably even today . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect its parks .
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my com@@ mons , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed from another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson at the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them going as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
&quot; from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot;
&quot; from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located . &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company company l@@ t@@ d. to 13th of April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , due to dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council . &quot;
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; it would not be possible to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher level of the inner city , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the forest hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual holiday@@ makers , groups or bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; looking at the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the outside systems are also brought forward to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Repres@@ entative sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Panel recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to persons committed to it . &quot;
the newspaper expressed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had extended and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between m@@ umps of el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; for some time now , US intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin to have targeted themselves in the 2016 presidential campaign . &quot;
Mu@@ eller explores if there were agreements between Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the course of the investigation , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environments . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Sonder@@ seek@@ er Tr@@ ump has moved to the centre and investig@@ ates whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jury are also called to be prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N station , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who participated in the meeting were asked to say that it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the interview . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening on the US television , legal experts said that the introduction showed that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the issue gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about .
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but I usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he won &apos;t be determined against the president .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ration@@ ality , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later @-@ tro@@ dden President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on ur@@ ging the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators proposed legislation on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin solved itself from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , dri@@ fts north@@ wards and will probably need two or three years until it was melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; according to researcher information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ hor@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
&quot; North of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf .
&quot; there is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C file cow@@ ard is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far as it is now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key site . &quot;
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of ice shelf allows the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project on Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) writes . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ic@@ e@@ sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the recording , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists argue whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf will grow back or fall in the long term and possibly collapse , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , in recent decades , however , many ice @-@ chi@@ cks of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic ranges towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to this decline .
&quot; over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees and thus en@@ umer@@ ates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to sta@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U ur@@ ges to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Circle Day has reached 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the administrative administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them . &quot;
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously highly sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be found for the number of places to be found this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers and general administration personnel are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , showing concrete measures for career star@@ ters and involve a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good starting point .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which you didn &apos;t know before . &quot;
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is &quot; &quot; competition for public employers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees who leave the service are due to illness or age . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the highest time for action so that there will be no more places left un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he took care of a big surprise already in the circle of the circle , when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the other parties . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow exit from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the administrative district with the trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a ho@@ ary tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U attempts to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the public service &apos;s tari@@ ff bill . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when switching to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone for NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; because their crew had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the preliminary rounds of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in a statement on the social media . &quot;
we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after collecting all the information and assessing the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue mission in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan may@@ ors over economic development initiatives this month and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine young bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley turned out to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , after Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , we went to the Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular Party . &quot;
&quot; again , the look@@ out point rested on the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; inter@@ tw@@ ined &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed the sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga prepares for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium in the wind and the weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ it included . &quot;
&quot; these have also recognised the first federal states , who are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg won the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that there are many clubs coming up on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first Inter@@ active Club World Cup , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian markets . &quot;
&quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , one could be far more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the German lig@@ aments to Asia . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the FIFA World Cup FIFA are being challenged at the E @-@ Sport . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , they have long since established le@@ agues where professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the 2022 World Cup , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it really a kind of sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to the ordinary . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been confronted with the question .
&quot; for Professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sport , such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to responsi@@ veness . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should train and respect their body not only on the console but also on their body .
&quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , &quot; &quot; D@@ oping is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are on the go international , that &apos;s like a big global family , there &apos;s no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
&quot; as a result , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016 , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
sales are expected to be 130 million in three years .
&quot; this , however , is little against the € 2.4 billion of the Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Consult@@ ants . &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition @-@ provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in European comparison Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; just in nostal@@ gia , and clearing the old times is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football remains as it was always .

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to a neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the Roy &apos;s father said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no repentance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not regret the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us to be for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more to have this single person with whom I was together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge someone to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote , &quot; You must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; all you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she would benefit from any press .
the case has the legal opinion divided .
&quot; Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 , was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter before being acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning about the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m from FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es to give the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation does not hurt there .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the binding halt to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner told afterwards , after his first bet as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of the coach could interpret Kim@@ i as well .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f competition from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of vacation , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is best distributed to those , to whom you have a lot of trust you want to keep in your mood . &quot;
those who have been chosen to enter Lah@@ m &apos;s heritage can use a little extra motivation only well .
&quot; Kim@@ i confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old ti@@ cked as a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ mich took part in this initial formation , like the one who can best take the ru@@ dder into his hand . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to steer the un@@ seas@@ oned trou@@ pe .
&quot; he had the view to the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus to re@@ play his missing fitness ( collap@@ sed barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to make the services of the Asia trip ( also only conditional ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in her first appearance in Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not to be negative . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and addic@@ ts also tried a few times in the game set @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as unusual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs there were not one or two interviews , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s best @-@ known foot@@ ball@@ ers reported about Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wanted all the best .
the Bayern @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary is quasi a club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our ladies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation sy@@ ringe .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing picks up the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the Autobahn 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country at the top .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is expected to be the right of construction . &quot;
&quot; the western population of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Dutch spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; as von Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) is aiming for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that have been sin@@ king for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Crafts of Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; there is a premium of 1000 Euro for the passed Master &apos;s exam and 2,500 euros , if graduates settle for themselves within ten years after the master &apos;s training . &quot;
but the list of home@@ work for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction will quickly provide facts , at the same time missing the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , who wish to set up Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied so far . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U vice @-@ president points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of national roads by 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country concept to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind force company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she has already cleared the field because of in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot;
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a reaction reaction
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the BMW said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than restrictions , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust f@@ umes generated by diesel vehicles , also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of sil@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing any signs of the problem .
&quot; companies attempt to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but drive back under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could severely burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer bears dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft goes through Munich tomorrow morning , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go back to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a nasty float , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the construction department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big source of information .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a public relations campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen the wild river . &quot;
&quot; already last summer , the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ing n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most popular cartoon characters , the no@@ d@@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - what frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures fro@@ ze in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table , according to his own data , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures still find much dis@@ sem@@ ination worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
&quot; the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings , which has a jack of thousands as a counter player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threat@@ ens climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions remin@@ ding of drought , the la@@ ven@@ der is decreasing due to insects which are remin@@ ding of drought , which makes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only l@@ ures for holiday@@ makers but also for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered are a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with an average age party .
&quot; dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants or a country camp should be experienced in the city centre these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupted civil servants and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , sens@@ ations and gut feelings are sufficient . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are present : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the kill@@ ings linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely confronted with justice . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are not comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is now even more tra@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
the second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues on the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drugs problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the paper earned itself a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters liked to publish hard hit studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were intrigu@@ ed by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you are listening to as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse a port worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love to the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
&quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ way and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells bad , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters questioned whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor herself considered as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for this week &apos;s edition , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures , concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown . &quot;
&quot; there was a group located in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers would have watched the Val@@ dez column as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
&quot; re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs , and the next morning went to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it &apos;s theirs .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked her to be re@@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who were under a blanket with the organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
apparently the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , states that the drug trade is scar@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tape ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the cur@@ b , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via cell phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens lift up close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were willing .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern called me to send them to the street reporting . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain farmer were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved , ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ r specimens . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all of this hard work , the finished result is ready now to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum , where the creature was to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ defense which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better with his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to carefully expose it . &quot;
the astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ shad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ shad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ shad@@ owing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics concerning his life , including his preserved gut , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da nowadays , and rivers and oceans likely much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered by preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use lots of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just stra@@ y a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when gigantic ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that were on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that prot@@ ru@@ de from its shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swept away by the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater hull of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so good that the cut@@ ters still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; its right front foot rests on its side , its five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles were transported to a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , around 17@@ .00 h between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , were crashing against each other . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information was given about the exact number of pla@@ inti@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it was a light to moderate injury , said a police spokesman . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of direction Munich , a ten kilometres long back @-@ jam formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported as an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also a massive han@@ di@@ cap on the counter @-@ road to massive han@@ di@@ caps - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now have to face sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing , you sit in the train and sleep . &quot;
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ el .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the trouble @-@ free ticket control .
&quot; it is simply confirmed by mobile phone , that one takes its place and thus evalu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test facility is running on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D spokesman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the railway the ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , some conditions must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
&quot; you must also have bought it via the train &apos;s app , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
a button on the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
&quot; if the train atten@@ dant arrives at room Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with a paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspections by our train atten@@ dant , the DB navig@@ ator simply checks for yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr Marketing Director . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains the ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences .
&quot; often , in any case , one of the passengers does not have all the documents required for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or any document you have to assign . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad m@@ oods in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further gn@@ ats on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; do Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken up to her core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after they arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road . &quot; &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else posted information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah has always been saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police tape and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; that is not common , &quot; she rec@@ alled her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance , which consists in the view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Ferr@@ ell , with her daughter , carrying a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any ec@@ lat@@ ory racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; &quot; she said , notic@@ ing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; Ferr@@ ell answered a question : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community who benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism rum around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Ferr@@ ell , along with six other locals , followed the &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; team in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there has to be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ birds Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we constantly fight on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;

&quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who vibr@@ ated this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though she was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .

from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation of 2009 , divi@@ des the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot;
it &apos;s hard to get cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while those say to the bit gallery , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the other shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is ble@@ ed off . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property in which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be an end . &quot;
gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very gladly . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s dairy for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot;
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle down depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; the new project will probably not be low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some have been waiting for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , most of the time is directly offered by the producer and is reasonably priced . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a pity , specialty shops are almost no longer and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t suit me .
and the gallery does not fit in to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the farmer &apos;s market hall go in during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes . &quot;
or does the Ge@@ ot@@ st bit gallery already manage to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that simply won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty doesn &apos;t need anyone .
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no place thanks to the ins@@ ane many - like me - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair clips that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st imposed a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after publicly denoun@@ cing diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a fitting simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the analysis of DNA that was extracted from man@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit a somewhat intellectual comment not only to the ability of DNA data , but also to create the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hit by the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ tery and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ ec@@ onds , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; indeed , only a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy encounter . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops , to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a given reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her excessive signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in organic terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will take is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges from the discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ free speech .
&quot; if they cool your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted him from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ers , who assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
&quot; a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who were considered susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued warran@@ ts of murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the scene and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ it has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that it was now in a prim@@ acy and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is a criminal case that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be present .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help finding the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that lay@@ outs and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ President Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ establishing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the Organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ inous words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales outlet at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal of the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing checks in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA General Manager Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli commented that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs for the time being
this divided the Group &apos;s groups .
&quot; it was a purely precau@@ tionary measure that could no longer be considered by any adverse health impairment , it was stated in the Communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on only eggs will be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lum@@ bar . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency in his customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure my luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the poll@@ s did not work .
&quot; the answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she called for help from outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demo@@ graphical groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap Sur@@ veys and Sur@@ veys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the new Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and recognise bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber F@@ oods in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; scent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS Hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion condem@@ ns the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ved in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and lam@@ ination , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations of the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and strain the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; in November , the gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their workplaces than before .
highly sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only jobs in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
the employees want to have the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employee after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow frustr@@ ations and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; when you ask for 4000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you do not follow people ask themselves , &quot; Di@@ d you really listen to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported to be saved .
&quot; and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
&quot; it starts at 11 pm , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus . &quot;
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey @-@ pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Water Resource Center at 6 : 30 am next morning .
&quot; that &apos;s a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and they actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Brotherhood moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as spent six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the change in control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if it adds another point to the player &apos;s busy routes . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous burden three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ ough on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear si@@ ghting of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been allocated with foot@@ balls that have a protective net behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; break @-@ ins should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then hire oneself to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit warnings to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false messages and send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors , which may be displaying results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , while the French voters were flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to knowing which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was visible in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shire man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England is spann@@ ing the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived nearly four months in a castle ( &apos; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting a little &apos; ) this all seems too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena @-@ heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , employees began to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who possessed what : &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go in motion ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book called &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising started in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
maybe they are connected with each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ r@@ ell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is presented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite Ga@@ un@@ er to always make debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ lady . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his commitment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the revelation of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team wish to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it will be the highlight of the campaign to celebrate a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; they write on their website which was un@@ locked yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ alone promise , one which gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , she stands in the competition with other local authorities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost an average five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on pen@@ sion@@ ing and promotions in the officer &apos;s cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as formerly but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the head of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions . &quot;
this resulted in the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army &apos;s ranks - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the I@@ nex@@ il Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who Erdo@@ gan sees as the clin@@ ker of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara is negotiating this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but has Erdo@@ gan really got a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the great deal in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed another 73@@ 95 government ear@@ ners , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly believed to be the real masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan once again pushed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is pushing forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who searched for asylum abroad after the coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if that happens , NATO could not get cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato &apos;s diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by issuing the way to citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race @-@ up shuttle
over and over again over the past few months over the future of the platform shuttle - now it should go quite fast .
&quot; even before the end of the year , it is planned to be built on the di@@ o@@ des track on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track should begin in the long term to secure the future of the wheel@@ base shuttle . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; declared Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repair of the track was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future by the country , will be final , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the race @-@ racing shuttle will be scheduled for regular orders on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; over the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people in order to order them again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is considerably slu@@ gg@@ ish in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are a big thing right now .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of nip@@ ples to type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have become robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , comm@@ its one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compatible with a vibr@@ ator on its website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men , of course , will not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noticed their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what escap@@ es from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots have emerged in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened throughout the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has sur@@ rendered to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women . &quot;
&quot; the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the winding bodies and the po@@ ke eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid
dr@@ um@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
&quot; it became a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving feast there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ ting relatives .
we are all strictly speaking to have our filter bags burst .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lin@@ ks@@ y poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the repub@@ lican kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is noticeable in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; , &quot; we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that his bi@@ bs one day will no longer rep@@ el us . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to his standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the ma@@ d@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact appear to be a very mild off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans has to be mentally sound to qualify as an inv@@ alu@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York car park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ loving music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a big round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience since two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies years can go on it and have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , during this week I was forced to rate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ inning , while I was tired of having my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first sla@@ b .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarters of F@@ uses and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; in the future , three of the students go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte greeted parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental Ci@@ tiz@@ ens House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ ble band introduced a musical titled &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and leav@@ ed it from his chickens .
instead of a chicken ch@@ ick a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it beat , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a hen &apos;s dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished each neighbourhood to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps in with teaching staff , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is over now , class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only divor@@ ced her students , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were deta@@ ined for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television , spoke to them . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally tents arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls continue throughout the season .
the ministry said the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel engine , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
&quot; Anja S@@ met@@ anin , the ACE Car Club Europe , gives assessments : &quot;
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates that are dealt with are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have become the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has been ordered by the German Federal Rail@@ road Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to write to any person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due , then it will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; it &apos;s hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , such as S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; up to now , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the worshi@@ ppers this year . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the award winner Le@@ ar announced , with progressive TV series , announced that he would not be able to attend the gala . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ised that she will use Tr@@ ump to discuss her view .
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the previous award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker has been a city building master for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
at the same time it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; with regard to the regular periods of notice , it should be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ ten@@ ant authority for the administrative community , the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and the city itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate as well as good mood among authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have been accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is confident about the building and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot are encountered .
&quot; the kin@@ ship bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will be boo@@ sted by around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is room for a city building master . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gardening , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master stresses . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city building master bears great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; at the end everything is going over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on long @-@ standing employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; according to the city of Has@@ lach , anyone who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor with special@@ isation in architecture and possess good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , construction management , municipal property management , urban farm yard with building yard and urban gardening , as well as the Lower House of Civil Rights , including the preservation of historic monuments . &quot;
bike thrown on lines : locked South Railway Line
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and are looking for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a red sco@@ oter and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; that goes far beyond the realm of Laus@@ anno@@ is , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put themselves in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation , as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen will also be able to reach the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , from a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokesman said . &quot;
&quot; the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , railway traffic on the southern track could be managed without any obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning , two of them affected the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead cables had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to avoid meats and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the senior researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
cells that are able to cause inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said , &quot; We have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet that is rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han is more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , when the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been separated , had not had this . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA @-@ sequ@@ enced and six types of bacteria were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice lining , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same toler@@ ating cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the Hol@@ der role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the club for that , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US airplane manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US State Mich@@ ig@@ an and with@@ drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
the radar screens were the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind is turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only a bon@@ fire from the party &apos;s headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been monitoring events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach by head@@ winds . &quot;
there were downs .
one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Bund @-@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green cannot simply rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the unexpected faction of a Green party , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a heavy crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its single votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Party Chief Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ essa to give her mandate back .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s desire .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ester must immediately give back her mandate , &quot; said the German Federal Executive Director and election campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; he si@@ ghs an SPD election fighter when the new ob@@ session of the party reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands out for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the tak@@ eover of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ung . &quot;
it is the provisional apo@@ gee of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades were reas@@ sured at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; it was then - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tum@@ ble , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te fl@@ atten@@ ed the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously stir@@ red up in the weeks after@@ ward .
&quot; then , when they had just picked new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD fighter , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communications , he did wrong everything that could be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony @-@ based Prime Minister has been in charge of criticism for quite some time now . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l always tried to accentu@@ ate accents in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , even in the context of Martin Schulz , did not remain hidden . &quot;
they let him do as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all at all .
&quot; for the time being , comrades struggle to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ essa . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and more democratic as Mrs. T@@ ires places her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ung has not been elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to the parliament over the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , according to the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago the elec@@ torate was clear : the people made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony @-@ based SPD as a leading candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career opportunities of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he demanded to elu@@ ci@@ date the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or given further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
grants for local core III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate over the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development on Wednesday expressed his feelings . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened . &quot;
since 1991 there have been in sensi@@ ti@@ zing areas of rehabilitation .
&quot; back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the area of rehabilitation II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - ultimately it is important to also promote the internal development , and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be an area of rehabilitation III . &quot;
&quot; the sum amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500,000 Euros would come from the country , the rest from the municipality . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; according to Sch@@ in@@ dler , one would further investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area at all . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territorial boundaries could then also be shifted again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the bridge was represented by Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; basement presented the contents of the federal federal program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the restructuring area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; since January 1 , 2017 , the approval period for the funds has expi@@ red until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey would take place only once , within the scope of which the participants in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the stat@@ ute must be given as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every commun@@ e had to carry out the forec@@ asted research . &quot;
the aim is to assess and decide the urban planning ab@@ norm@@ alities when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will also be a rec@@ itation note in the land register for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that the project was a key success factor for the project .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; Building and Real Estate &quot; , &quot; in which it is concerned among other things , the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; , &quot; data on size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; business sheet &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes . &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; local kern II &quot; were shown to make a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military , left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is aboard , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter produced in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited alongside a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire engine and a fork @-@ lift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy commander of the Navy for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and so long , until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House would be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second squ@@ ad would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time of the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February when the president &apos;s plane was before the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 training land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew eleven hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of Un@@ ity record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D not include personnel costs , but account for the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
fron@@ trun@@ ner of the Second Tennis League will join the stand@@ ings of the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the fron@@ trun@@ ner of the Second Tennis League has won the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorfer , imports from the high north are above all concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ sey ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; currently at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not join the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing with the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , will be at his first use this season . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ las@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo won the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , also Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could be back to the team . &quot;
&quot; it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ res out of the train@@ ee staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress contained a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US . &quot;
&quot; at least , the draft envis@@ ages pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the O@@ MV , which together with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the North Stream 2 Baltic Sea in cooperation with other European companies . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him .
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the series of hits of Net@@ fli@@ x is put into the spotlight &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bit@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1 September .
roll back : the city show@@ cases 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the urban centres of kinder@@ gar@@ tens , the watch is turned back . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in the municipal children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ich , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking continues to be out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; in the last Kit@@ ee year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week , lunch at the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff will have kitchen service from September 1st . they heat up the delivered dishes , add salad , raw vegetables and fruit , and serve the meal individually , clean up the food , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly attached to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
it makes sense to directly connect the kitchen power to the team .
for the children too .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - is carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in the education area , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban published threats against an election process that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international hos@@ ti@@ lities to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ on said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

men attempt to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
&quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused , however , and went on with her friends . &quot;
&quot; then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which however failed . &quot;
&quot; without prey , the du@@ et fled . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concerned about investing in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a trade union wants to wi@@ den its long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow in the case of managers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is produced alongside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that workers and union representatives would &quot; experience first &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; concerns &quot; &quot; that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of ra@@ y@@ cross , our members deeply concern our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glas@@ gow area , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the store manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react immediately , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously review our business - and this applies to all of our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our overseas location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after issuing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a stern warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players signing , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to tear down under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oters dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has intentionally upset one sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 , and thus caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s fair@@ ing of over 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; the police of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for clu@@ es . &quot;
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um came with his VW on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the city hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger came to meet him in his lane so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver touched the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on the passenger car , material damage was made . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the sever@@ ity of the accident , it may be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ ar driver had not noticed the accident . &quot;
the police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the judgment vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Cathedral @-@ spar@@ row report rati@@ fies Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the opinion of the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication of the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as the cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
&quot; it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that in reporting about violence in the Dom@@ o@@ j@@ ab pads it was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ment in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was remarkable , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you like to go on the church and that &apos;s a missing fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows would have been a very normal educational tool , &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory tape &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says E@@ zek@@ iel , &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high plau@@ sibility . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could be more violent .
&quot; in contrast to numerous other accused , however , many victims of the general humanity of R. assessed and therefore in numerous cases even able to combine positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr E@@ zek@@ iel , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against the protection of protection in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible in the ec@@ lip@@ se when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was musi@@ cally not top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all . &quot;
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the ex@@ tor@@ tion of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can pres@@ ume to experience it too late or not have taken the first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz grammar school in which he worked was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is how the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; &quot; always moved from grapes to children &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ined about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to wre@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; he had already admitted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the fact that he was not only sk@@ inn@@ ed with chairs and throwing the keys on the floor , but also drew ear @-@ cow@@ ls and too fre@@ ak@@ y guys to the hair or ears . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state grammar school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the ex@@ tor@@ tion of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are , of course , bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; one wonders , whether it is not more with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media fell on him straight . &quot;
&quot; on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot was reported about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report any involvement or involvement regarding sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said a victim representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims of shame remain silent . &quot;
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; in terms of sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; I think it is ... also for really absurd to assume that it is imp@@ uted to him ... more intru@@ sive and more clear or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , tru@@ sts , etc . &quot;
that talking to him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that the student and / or their surroundings were familiar with him in advance , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any fellow @-@ knowledge . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to an ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; ex@@ tor@@ tion of violence &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge amount of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and anywhere , in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , we say , other alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral head of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were actually victi@@ mi@@ zed and mal@@ treated and s@@ led among them , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only had to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz @-@ gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , might even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be looked away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he was just beginning to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently close the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz grammar school , which even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out to them , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the test penalty should continue . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent interven@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ishments were banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they acquired themselves in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers might have been exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible border had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis stated that it is unfair to apply contemporary pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards . &quot;
the princess was right .
&quot; but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ inable at all times , and not for what was f@@ aded in the pre @-@ school of hos@@ tility and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all aw@@ ful , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipline and punishment , that is to say , ear @-@ cow@@ ards and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describe in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ fer &apos;s sentence also come to terms with language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , the Cathedral @-@ cats only played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not by any means conf@@ ine that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; even that must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , yet discipline , passion and self @-@ exagger@@ ation . &quot;
what kind of people did you see Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do anything for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get in touch with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his work , to visit him regularly , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the dom@@ es are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely dis@@ respect person , to which they still look and worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clear : all that is presented to him are educational methods , which were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long over@@ came this time .
&quot; but it is extremely un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
the evil intention behind it is only too obvious .
&quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves the burden on him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
