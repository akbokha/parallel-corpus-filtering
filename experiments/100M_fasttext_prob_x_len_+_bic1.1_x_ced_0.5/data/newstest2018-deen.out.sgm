<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that will change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners farms the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich fosters exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows everyone who had to get excited because the car navigation system instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - yet precisely because of this very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it becomes clear, how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that can be recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for cities and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called" "documents" "were incorporated into the great map."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were made according to the Bavarian association of surveying between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph further drove the project forward, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thereby the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek 'website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a small-part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flush from the so-called" "original recording" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels now show no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow - and not a concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street names" on the guest-dough "or on the rise" on the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt "in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich District IrrenInstitute" "Auf der Lünen" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought to Ludwig II's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the accusation of the so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use force against occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"there was first place for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Haar in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now meeting in the area of the former institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order purchased the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in 2015 - architecturally based on the original construction of the Irrenanstalt which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "Main Square" "in 1856, the shopping street was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city center."</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once situated at the Marienhof, where these days are the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens voting group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farmers' promotion has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to become effective until 28 August 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here," says the group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who disproportionately aim against minorities, prompted the group to issue warnings, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of the civil rights that people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Missouri Public Prosecutor's Office, showing that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring cash or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sup a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidebarn project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the cemetery of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fishermen's Association of CDU met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he managed 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only Regionales arrives.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weifences project as" fundamental. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"on such steep areas, I cannot achieve profitable economies."</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area is a lot of work, much needed to be handled with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not run any bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that" the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is glad to be the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they will continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total costs amounting to 71 500 euros, half was promoted via leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and maidens."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiß asserted that" "the best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides the state-of-the-art sponsorship of female fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to disclose the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be tubelated (inclination of more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherman's Weifences project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 12,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence, the carefully staged downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated battle with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals by the President for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiters would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed the meaning, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained:" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you relate that was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your arms, / your afflicted masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable trash" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trump USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict of the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of her death - knew very well that she performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus amended the significance of the statue, the right wing people wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservatives, bringing the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to lighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"rather unusual, Limbaugh stumbled upon something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch is not meant to illuminate the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the UK's athletics, Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, which will start on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special is being developed in Scotland" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," "Black said."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as a team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medalists, who compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, say that it is" "unbelievable" "that 16 Schotten are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir runs on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that one should watch after a great season involving the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me, it makes me something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scotts belonging to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't get around a public office if you can't tolerate the burning of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shrank in the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," "said a lot of people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is astonishingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, blocking individuals who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans of Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not like this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor referred to as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No.1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who last year led the Archerfield to the final round, before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I have seen how the Renaissance-Club was built, and we see how he achieved fame with this event," said Rafferty. "</seg>
<seg id="210">"players will see this course from its best side, it's in a great state."</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry did a great job when he set this place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="215">"that really feels special," "said the home-based player in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year I had won them.</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It 'a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we always appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour following his 50th birthday this year, returns to the action on home soil."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," Orr, the man from Helensburgh, said. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy as to how it has been done.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the trio in the field are the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNut."</seg>
<seg id="228">"ORR and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond."</seg>

<seg id="232">"over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of passive smoking in lung cancer."</seg>
<seg id="233">"to this end, scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are present in a study."</seg>

<seg id="241">"traffic, which is always obstructing the construction, represents a major problem for the construction trup of the company Stumpp."</seg>

<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the carbonized tuber is taken with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example to wash dresses with cloudy water from the nearby swamp."</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a sheltered room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, her fields were not assigned."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course, too late to work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around the village after 17 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua New Guinea took part in the eastern part of the island."</seg>

<seg id="275">"an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid close to 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer."</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="282">"the screws have increased, since Papuas resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia."</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most comforting provinces of Papua and West papua: visa denidency and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the MarshallIslands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua (including the Paniai Shoundry)."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 Years of St. Hilarius's Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16 at 4.30pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Urcustomizbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the documents according to the documents, on the Tumlinger hill, apart from the former parish church, there was also a wonderful courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village-picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "is the third, the wonderful settlement-nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 are underpinned by these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest, continued to remain the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in this way, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two crunches on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later it had to be handed over to the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the window panes were inserted and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"during the New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half fell."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years of the old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the" creative pensioners "as successor of Dieter Dockhorn, the Hilarius plant."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery at the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"Hartmut Romann, a local leader, speaks the final word."</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is available from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to conclude the serenade, a trunk is held in front of the graveyard."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers offer fantastic views. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance to Tumlingen and Hörschweiler."</seg>

<seg id="739">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that states are obliged to curb the smog-causing emissions. this took place a day after 15 states sued the agency because of the step.</seg>

<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room for this.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the municipal council are suspended from seeing such a common space just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of senianism, but openly into the church."</seg>
<seg id="755">"as an example, the word" "knitting café" "made the lap."</seg>
<seg id="756">"the decision, which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the running household in autumn, is made by funding opportunities."</seg>

<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, there is no surplus, but will get a real equivalent, in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech."</seg>
<seg id="767">"the motion of Staigers, to split the proposal accordingly, finds three proponents."</seg>

<seg id="862">"with the first round of the season Andre Hoffmann was happy, with the result also, would not have been the two opponents at 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"that were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out in Aue even better," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three chain is to be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">And a gate after a free blast does not want to catch the Fortunen any more.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no one else besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better after the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four-legged chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"yet I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we are in the three chain at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we can harmonise even better and we do not make so many misleading mistakes in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"whether you can speak after a draw from an unsuccessful start, don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could be okay," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a good season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer wanted to know nothing about this.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I only judge the start into the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the play of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season virtually with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher since they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know as 100 percent where they are at the moment," says the inside defense of the Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"although the guests from the Rhineland take the chance to get a favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium, Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga which you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas head coach. "</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years old or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person" may be under 18 years old. ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said to the magazine The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years old or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>

<seg id="897">"a skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work entails assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they used to go through puberty sooner or later."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>

<seg id="998">"the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has experienced some very hot times, and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reuse Russia," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending on European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid $222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars relocation to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make money, so that Neymar writes down and bring it to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the Qatari power rich in energy."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources, which allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, following his election to the UEFA President in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP publishing period that runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini has dropped from the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to frighten himself from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause from Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum total of €44.4 million can be reported in the financial statements for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs seeking to overlay their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>

<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>

<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing up.</seg>
<seg id="1152">"the Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it maintained interest rates on family income in the midst of increased pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members increasing in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that in the next few years interest rate increases would be necessary to rein the inflation forecast by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package, which was published one year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"to the interest rates, she repeated that" "a certain tightening of monetary policy" "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" "slightly larger" "scale than the markets would expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank emphasised that elevations would be" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">"the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year, adjusted downwards, are expected to be 1.9% and 1.7% in May."</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">"according to these news, the pound was against the dollar and the euro."</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change will occur after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations on a interest rate rise, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households concerned with rising inflation and minor wage increases, as the tightening is getting worse at first, before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot" "prevent incomes", "but she added that wages will be" "clear" "at the end of their three-year forecasts."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which is partly offset by lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the fall of the pound.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final judgement on interest rates, the call for interest rates was rising, as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the exceedance in relation to its goal of 2% was to "wholly" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers said:" in view of the recent downturn in Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive, as the creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the high court against financing the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by health care via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the allegation that the local authorities should finance him."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England leader Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prep prevention (prep) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission among infections.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, appropriate participants will be identified which agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt-in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the overall potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as it is used in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in coping with one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, aimed at targeted and vulnerable people, offers the possibility of modifying the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We sincerely welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine was obtained, we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow Minister of Health, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delayed implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt will bring us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi, from Notting Hill, to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel structure is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moutain lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all joys and jars."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding cuisines are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is objectionable, so that when you push the door very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>

<seg id="1355">Brothers struggle for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">"two brothers reside four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of Victorias's largest real estate imperialists worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 properties valued at more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city area, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin is described by Paul as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin's property has $316 million and has valued $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the comments proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, the first hearing by the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul affirms, has excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accused Paul of managing several possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held by law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. de Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicatessen businesses from the late 1950's and in the early seventies bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first jeans in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, whereas Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"Luke and Mark are said," Paul says, "about the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept himself very reluctant even though he was a former member of the AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin responded by SMS to say" "I really can't say much" "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to suck me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute," "he said, adding that he still hope for a solution."</seg>
<seg id="1386">"on Friday, this hope seemed to be over."</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House staff chief is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information falling into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"political cos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keep drunk Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever" "under control" "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fighting officials know something that we do not know - that Trumps Tweets would have even more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his associates managed it several times to keep anger from him, their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers, the president for strategic reasons, to supply doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously offered a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started questioning people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former chief of staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1431">The intact group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry inhabitants urged the Council of Solihull, who said that it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said," They went there on Monday evening after being sent to Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by. "</seg>

<seg id="1444">"from Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise"</seg>
<seg id="1445">"from the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is located."</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company company ltd. to 13th of April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, due to dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction shuttles have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is still much to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built-in."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "nicely bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer is expressing."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"it would not be possible to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a higher level of the inner city, Scherer emphasises."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the forest hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual holidaymakers, groups or businesspeople should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"looking at the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"under one million euros, he calculates."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outside systems are also brought forward to the front, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant which is public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Representative sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the Panel recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "on appeal to persons committed to it."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper expressed the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between mumps of eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">"for some time now, US intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin to have targeted themselves in the 2016 presidential campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller explores if there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the course of the investigation, several men are to stand who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more trumps of private and business environments."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Sonderseeker Trump has moved to the centre and investigates whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the wake of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jury are also called to be prosecutors."</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN station, invitations were issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting were asked to say that it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trump Jared Kushner and his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his team leader Paul Manafort also participated in the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening on the US television, legal experts said that the introduction showed that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the charging of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the implementation of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">The issue gives the Democrats a chance to "feel good" because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but I usually work in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he won't be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rationality, accusations against Trump have become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said before a Senate Committee in June, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations about whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later-trodden President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on urging the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators proposed legislation on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin solved itself from the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, drifts northwards and will probably need two or three years until it was melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest iron giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to researcher information, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhors floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhorseshoe is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this ice shelf, the balance of waxing and abrupt was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that even the Larsen-C file coward is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far as it is now."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key site."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of ice shelf allows the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project on Antarctica (Midas) writes."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C shelf is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the icesign is now in a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the recording," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists argue whether the Larsen-C shelf will grow back or fall in the long term and possibly collapse," said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, however, many ice-chicks of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic ranges towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees and thus enumerates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to stastarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU urges to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, the Circle Day has reached 41 new jobs in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the administrative administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously highly sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be found for the number of places to be found this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"currently, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers and general administration personnel are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, showing concrete measures for career starters and involve a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good starting point.</seg>
<seg id="1565">"because the circle has to do with personnel problems, which you didn't know before."</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is" "competition for public employers". ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, a high number of employees who leave the service are due to illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"therefore, the highest time for action so that there will be no more places left unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he took care of a big surprise already in the circle of the circle, when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and baffled the other parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow exit from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the administrative district with the trade unions - perhaps also in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a hoary tariff," "</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone for NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "said Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation "Youth Rettet" because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the preliminary rounds of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that at the moment we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in a statement on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge any accusations that are currently being collected after collecting all the information and assessing the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered directly from traffickers and that smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue mission in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs, who are involved in search and rescue operations, have so far agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organisation is Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors over economic development initiatives this month and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were again and again longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">"on the second day, after Bad Dürkheim, we went to the Saline and the Popular Party."</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, the lookout point rested on the lookout point, connected by" intertwined "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters were announced."</seg>

<seg id="1615">"these have also recognised the first federal states, who are increasingly involved in this area."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"in the beginning of 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg won the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>

<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to the ordinary."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobous has long been confronted with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sport, such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to responsiveness."</seg>

<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of the E-Sports."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the go international, that's like a big global family, there's no cross-cultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"as a result, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to be 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"this, however, is little against the €2.4 billion of the Bundesliga."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June due to a negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no repentance."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance that she regretted." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that their" age or ripeness "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day when I do not regret the loss of my beloved son. ""</seg>

<seg id="1679">"no more to have this single person with whom I was together since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to urge someone to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, jump from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several news, which she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was with his family on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote," You must do it, Conrad "and" all you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she would benefit from any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has the legal opinion divided.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder on her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was one of the few who defended Carter before being acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cichade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only lures for holidaymakers but also for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened."</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">"the solutions that are considered are a better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly paper Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupted civil servants and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, sensations and gut feelings are sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no respite from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely confronted with justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in the case of Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are not comforting and even though the terrain is now even more traitors."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelve river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues on the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drugs problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the paper earned itself a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters liked to publish hard hit studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you are listening to as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse a port worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love to the routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runway and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells bad, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor herself considered as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for this week's edition, Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposure to the state expenditures, concentrated on the governor's hometown."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers would have watched the Valdez column as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs, and the next morning went to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it's theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked her to be redivided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book," Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, who were under a blanket with the organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">Apparently the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note signed by the Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua, after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay back and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, states that the drug trade is scaring him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I was reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to buzz."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with tape rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the curb, they published the news on the website of Riodoce via cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens lift up close to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept watch to see if they were willing.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if the same day when Javier was murdered, the intern called me to send them to the street reporting."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain farmer were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described it as" the best-preserved, armored dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the world's best dinosaur specimens. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved condition has startled researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he founded on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all of this hard work, the finished result is ready now to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature was to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with a armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique known as a counter-defense which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better with his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully expose it."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shadowing is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shadowing - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous dinosaurs must have been the chalk-time," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics concerning his life, including his preserved gut, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida nowadays, and rivers and oceans likely much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered by preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use lots of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just stray a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when gigantic theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that were on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that protrude from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept away by the Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater hull of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so good that the cutters still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"its right front foot rests on its side, its five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"according to the first data of the police, around 17.00 h between the junction points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, were crashing against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, no information was given about the exact number of plaintiffs."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was a light to moderate injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of direction Munich, a ten kilometres long back-jam formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as reported as an AZ reporter, there was also a massive handicap on the counter-road to massive handicaps - by numerous Gaffer."</seg>

<seg id="1987">"it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing, you sit in the train and sleep."</seg>

<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we will expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said S & D spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort check-in" "calls the railway the ticket devaluation without a conductor."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, some conditions must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you must also have bought it via the train's app, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">"last but not least, you need a seat reservation."</seg>
<seg id="2003">"the" comfort check-in "works like this: one gets into the train, calls his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button on the electronic devaluation appears with the test customers.</seg>

<seg id="2006">"if the train attendant arrives at room Y, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with a paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent."</seg>

<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the identity card is missing, or any document you have to assign."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to bad moods in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2018">Further gnats on the same track are not unlocked yet.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "do Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after they arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment they rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a mail from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road." "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else posted information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has always been saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from St. Louis was killed, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live to tweets."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police tape and people shouting, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson's police killed just my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman said his gun and screamed:" "I'm going to kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not common," she recalled her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I was angry and cried." ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance, which consists in the view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell, with her daughter, carrying a flower-dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any eclatory racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," "she said, noticing that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"Ferrell answered a question:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community who benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism rum around Todestrakt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other locals, followed the" Whose Streets? "team in the years after Browning's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result documents of Whose Streets show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there has to be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "Blackbirds Matter" "in social media identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we constantly fight on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, she insists that" this is not an affirmatical type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who vibrated this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she walked into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation of 2009, divides the population into proponents and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">It's hard to get cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while those say to the bit gallery," that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That's really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the other shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleed off."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property in which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's dairy for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also this."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle down depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"the new project will probably not be low." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some have been waiting for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, most of the time is directly offered by the producer and is reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"it's a pity, specialty shops are almost no longer and what remains of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't suit me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit in to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the farmer's market hall go in during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the Geotst bit gallery already manage to drive all shops from Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty doesn't need anyone.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market hall there is no place thanks to the insane many - like me - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of Wangen-Tupfern and hair clips that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst imposed a 35-year custodial sentence after publicly denouncing diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a fitting similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg originated from the analysis of DNA that was extracted from maning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit a somewhat intellectual comment not only to the ability of DNA data, but also to create the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits comfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette buttery and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated Muse became unequal Brieffeconds, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" "Suppressed Images", "which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"indeed, only a few days after the book was published, Obama would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy encounter."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops, to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a given reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her excessive signature (the" i "in her surname is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in organic terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the Comic-Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands-free speech.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they cool your speech, then they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop your mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted him from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacers, who assemble like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also goal-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who were considered suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued warrants of murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acts of the District Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the scene and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lait has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that it was now in a primacy and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is a criminal case that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to be present.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves," Guglielmi said. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help finding the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that layouts and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice-President Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-establishing RUSADA and recently published on the Organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation, because our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"mutinous words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with Russian sales outlet at the beginning of the day, Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov. "</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 as part of the Doping scandal of the WADA by conducting doping checks in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure my luck with your e-commerce start-up but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"the answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is at waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographical groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistle-blowers allow to bypass the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.

<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the Snap Surveys and Surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished."</seg>

<seg id="2226">"sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - like discrimination, harassment or unfair traineeships."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>

<seg id="2236">"convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was visible in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshire man with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "he says wistfully."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England is spanning the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac handiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived nearly four months in a castle ('To be honest: I have overrated my welcome-greeting a little') this all seems too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" "new" "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena-heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey and began to write. ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"as Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees began to take care of the archive which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let everything go in motion!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book called 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising started in this area, and I thought that an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe they are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is presented from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed quite Gauner to always make debts and spend money for things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men solved their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landlady."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his commitment in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique screaming experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature again."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army's ranks - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Inexil Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who Erdogan sees as the clinker of the coup attempt."</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan decreed another 7395 government earners, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals formerly believed to be the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his victory in 2002, Erdogan once again pushed the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing right now.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of nipples to type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as much as possible," enthuses the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" in mood. ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape when one goes one step on Frigid (is here: resisting) Farrah, commits one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy compatible with a vibrator on its website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men, of course, will not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR noticed their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what escapes from the marginal zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots have emerged in a time when women's rights are threatened throughout the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has surrendered to have sexually assaulted women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') is not the graphic images, the winding bodies and the poke eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical likeness to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their growers want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place is already written out - however, suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city building master for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"with regard to the regular periods of notice, it should be enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts as a sub-tenant authority for the administrative community, the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the city and the city itself is important to him, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate as well as good mood among authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have been accumulated, looking back at the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city livable," he is confident about the building and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen parking lot are encountered.</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the kinship bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will be boosted by around 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is room for a city building master."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own yard and gardening, many things can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what fits in "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city building master stresses."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the city building master bears great responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a client," at the end everything is going over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also that his successor stays for a long time, Wacker wants:" we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"according to the city of Haslach, anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should have a completed degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor with specialisation in architecture and possess good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning law."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Stadtbauamt is subject to civil engineering, civil engineering, construction management, municipal property management, urban farm yard with building yard and urban gardening, as well as the Lower House of Civil Rights, including the preservation of historic monuments."</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike thrown on lines: locked South Railway Line</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for them since the night hours.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, a red scooter and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that goes far beyond the realm of Lausannois," "said ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA."</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have put themselves in great danger and jeopardized the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, as well as the delay-minute drive and the costs for rail transport, Pönalen will also be able to reach the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, from a" substantial "sum, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon, railway traffic on the southern track could be managed without any obstructions."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of them affected the correspondence."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall, but they had delay."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead cables had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to avoid meats and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan by proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to cause inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said," We have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet that is rich in tryptophan is more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, when the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been separated, had not had this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice lining, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerating cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2605">"at Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a" genius, "Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2606">"the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the Holder role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will."</seg>
<seg id="2607">"however, matic was excluded from the pre-preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season."</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," "said Mourinho."</seg>
<seg id="2609">We will help him sooner than later.</seg>
<seg id="2610">"besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season."</seg>
<seg id="2611">"the Independent revealed this week that Mourinho made three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a" fantastic job "to fulfil three of its four primary new commitments."</seg>
<seg id="2612">"three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2613">"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have taken great trouble."</seg>

<seg id="2615">The US airplane manufacturer Boeing has drawn the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">"the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington, but the drawing started in Marquette in US State Michigan and withdrew in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometers."</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action took 18 hours and a minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The radar screens were the form of a Dreamliner.</seg>

<seg id="2624">"only a bonfire from the party's headquarters, but no headwind from the Confederation, was the most important wish of the election fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has fundamentally changed."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described in the approach by headwinds."</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were downs.</seg>
<seg id="2629">One after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bund-CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once again: red-green cannot simply rule reliably," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber, Germany's editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">"the unexpected faction of a Green party, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), has plunged into a heavy crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the election, his red-green coalition thus lost its single votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green Party Chief Executive Officer Michael Kellner called on the rebellious Lower Saxony Euro MP Elke Tessa to give her mandate back.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's desire.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tester must immediately give back her mandate," said the German Federal Executive Director and election campaign leader of the Greens editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true at all," he sighs an SPD election fighter when the new obsession of the party reached the party headquarters on Friday morning. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands out for the CDU without his own government majority following the takeover of the green deputies Elke Tung."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional apogee of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miser began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"a blue eye, more not, the comrades were reassured at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"it was then - and indeed, everything became much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tumble, the Duesseldorf-Pleite flattened the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades were laboriously stirred up in the weeks afterward.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just picked new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg."</seg>

<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD fighter, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie, while his city was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">"and because in crisis communications, he did wrong everything that could be done wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW-exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony-based Prime Minister has been in charge of criticism for quite some time now."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for this reason, Weil always tried to accentuate accents in the past weeks."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, even in the context of Martin Schulz, did not remain hidden."</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him do as they promised a stabilization of the party by Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">"in doing so, Weil is not guilty of the party-internal constraint of the Lower Saxony Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz is not at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"for the time being, comrades struggle to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is directed towards the Greens, and here above all on the rebellious parliamentarian Tessa."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and more democratic as Mrs. Tires places her own career starters on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Mrs. Tung has not been elected as a direct candidate, but has been elected to the parliament over the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Lower Saxony deputies."</seg>

<seg id="2673">"in addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development on Wednesday expressed his feelings."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"at the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 there have been in sensitizing areas of rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"back then, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the area of rehabilitation II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the existing renovations are a" success project "- ultimately it is important to also promote the internal development, and not only to open up new construction areas."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be an area of rehabilitation III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the sum amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500,000 Euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a rehabilitation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"according to Schindler, one would further investigate where the" really old "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"however, it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area at all."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also be shifted again."</seg>

<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be object-related, that is, per plot."</seg>

<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the survey would take place only once, within the scope of which the participants in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the statute must be given as soon as possible, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann stated that every commune had to carry out the forecasted research."</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to assess and decide the urban planning abnormalities when it is rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a recitation note in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will once again come to sensations and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers according to the military, left to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is aboard, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter produced in Connecticut was exhibited alongside a yacht of Maine, a Wisconsin fire engine and a fork-lift truck from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event, the deputy commander of the Navy for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning and so long, until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House would be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second squad would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time of the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal workers to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "the commandant wrote."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the event" "Made in America" "was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"Trump led an investigation in February when the president's plane was before the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," "said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to set the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 introduced 58 training landings at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew eleven hours this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to Stundentarifen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget, the DoD reimbursement for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of Unity record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement sets is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD not include personnel costs, but account for the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to emphasize that.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire engine."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2882">"in the area of the city hustle and bustle of Stolzenau, a passenger came to meet him in his lane so that he had to turn right."</seg>
<seg id="2883">"in doing so, the Touran driver touched the guard rail."</seg>
<seg id="2884">"on the passenger car, material damage was made."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the driver of the coming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident."</seg>
<seg id="2886">"according to the severity of the accident, it may be good that the Mercedar driver had not noticed the accident."</seg>
<seg id="2887">The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the judgment vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Cathedral-sparrow report ratifies Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse is relieved by Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the opinion of the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" Wir sind Kirche, "declared after publication of the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the processes at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised the fact that in reporting about violence in the Domojab pads it was measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the encroachment in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful acts "that would be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation "was remarkable," said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you like to go on the church and that's a missing fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" blows would have been a very normal educational tool, "to be done with cheeky children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory tape" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "says Ezekiel," "because all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is written in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality the punishment for the students could be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other accused, however, many victims of the general humanity of R. assessed and therefore in numerous cases even able to combine positive memories with him in numerous cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Ezekiel, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence against the protection of protection in the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which became tangible in the eclipse when a Domspatz was musically not top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed by any suspicion of complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The extortion of violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can presume to experience it too late or not have taken the first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatz grammar school in which he worked was felt by practically all respondents as - literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"this is how the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony," "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere" "and" "understanding", "as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and" "always moved from grapes to children". ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to wrecks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he had already admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he was not only skinned with chairs and throwing the keys on the floor, but also drew ear-cowls and too freaky guys to the hair or ears."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the extortion of violence at the preschool, these are, of course, bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders, whether it is not more with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media fell on him straight."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot was reported about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report any involvement or involvement regarding sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "said a victim representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims of shame remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"Michael Hesemann:" "in terms of sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it is... also for really absurd to assume that it is imputed to him... more intrusive and more clear or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trusts, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That talking to him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the student and / or their surroundings were familiar with him in advance, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any fellow-knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to an ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "extortion of violence" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking out" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge amount of sexual abuse and nonviolence and anywhere, in the middle of George Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, we say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral head of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were actually victimized and maltreated and sled among them, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only had to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatz-gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject of" preschool "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatz gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, might even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in this way, at most, the accusation remains to be looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he was just beginning to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz grammar school, which even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out to them," that in the preschool the test penalty should continue. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervening."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they acquired themselves in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers might have been exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis stated that it is unfair to apply contemporary pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was faded in the pre-school of hostility and violence against innocent children's souls."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"it's all awful, and I'm glad that it will finally work."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for discipline and punishment, that is to say, ear-cowards and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger describe in the conversations with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüfer's sentence also come to terms with language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the Cathedral-cats only played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not by any means confine that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and sweets alone, the unruly boys don't even make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, yet discipline, passion and self-exaggeration."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you see Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger quite well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good people, from which one can't imagine that he could only do anything for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get in touch with him, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his work, to visit him regularly, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domes are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely disrespect person, to which they still look and worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clear: all that is presented to him are educational methods, which were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is extremely unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which has just been published, relieves the burden on him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand would command a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
